          "Description": "The U.S. Department of Energy&amp;apos;s Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER), and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), National Institute of Food and Agriculture (NIFA), hereby announce their interest in receiving applications for genomics based research that will lead to the improved use of biomass and plant feedstocks for the production of fuels such as ethanol or renewable chemical feedstocks. Specifically, applications are sought for fundamental research on plants that will improve biomass characteristics, biomass yield, or sustainability. Systems biology approaches to identify genetic indicators enabling plants to be efficiently bred or manipulated, or research to predict phenotype from underlying genotype that could lead to improved feedstock characterization and sustainability are also encouraged. Renewable energy from biomass has the potential to reduce or remove dependency on fossil fuels as well as reduce negative environmental impacts from emissions of greenhouse gases and toxic pollutants. Realizing this potential will require the simultaneous development of high yielding biomass production systems and bioconversion technologies that efficiently convert biomass energy into the forms of energy usable by industry. Most agricultural research to date has focused on enhancing the production of seeds, roots and tubers that are used for food and feed production. However, these improvements in food crops have frequently been directed towards increases in starch content with a corresponding reduction of lignocelluloses accumulation. Research applications are solicited for genomics-based research that will lead to improved utilization of plant biomass for the production of fuels such as ethanol or renewable chemical feedstocks. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) co ntinues a commitment, initiated in 2006, to conduct a fundamental research program in biomass genomics, to provide the scientific foundation to facilitate the use of lignocellulosic materials, either primary material or agricultural residues, for bioenergy and biofuels. The rationale for developing lignocellulosic crops for energy is that less intensive production techniques and poorer quality land can be used for these crops, thereby avoiding competition with food production on better quality land.",

          "Description": "This program will provide assistance to an institution to investigate and monitor of the effects of environmental contaminants on the breeding population numbers, reproduction, and immunological health of fish eating birds found in the Saginaw Bay, Raisin River and other Great Lakes Areas of Concern (AOCs), building on previous investigations in past years. To accomplish this goal, the recipient institution will collect new data to evaluate the status of fish eating bird population health relative to reference (non AOC) areas and to these same areas as measured in the past. The recipient institution must have a proven record of experience in working with these types of bird colonies in the Great Lakes and measuring specific immunological endpoints in order to maintain scientific integrity and comparability of data. In addition to the continuing work on colonial waterbird populations, reproduction, and immune function, the recipient institution will measure the same endpoints at an additional site (Bellow Island), evaluate potential influence of contaminants of emerging concern to those endpoints, and screen water and sediments samples for these contaminants in the studied watersheds. This is a notice of intent to award a single source grant without competition to Calvin College with Dr. Keith Grasman working on the project under justification 505DM 2.14B (2) &amp;amp; (4). The Service intends to award to this recipient without competition because Dr. Grasman is uniquely qualified to perform this study. He is the researcher that has demonstrated the associations between PCBs and suppression of T-cell-mediated immunity in herring gull and Caspian tern chicks at highly contaminated sites in the Great Lakes as well as associations with altered antibody-mediated immunity (Grasman et al. 1996. Grasman and Fox 2001, Grasman et al. 2012). Because Dr. Grasman has developed and used these immunological methods at these study sites over the past 20 years, data that he generates under this grant can be directly compared with past data to determine trends and restoration of Beneficial Use Impairments.",

Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms and conditions as stated in the Cooperative Agreement will apply to this Task Agreement. This effort will primarily investigate and research new methods for capturing and transferring thematic resource data (geospatial, tabular, images, documents, etc.) from multiple (often disparate and widely distributed) sources to enterprise data services. Information captured via these systems also will be ported to various GIS, asset management services, and other database and web applications for sharing among partners, NPS personnel and the public RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT &amp;#9679; Provide research associates under the supervision of the Principal Investigator. &amp;#9679; CSU researchers will participate in cooperative teams with the NPS that may be led by either party. Close working relationships with outside partners and affiliates and substantial involvement of multiple programs will be required to successfully complete this task. &amp;#9679; Provide monthly invoices paid upon receipt NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: &amp;#9679; RISD staff members and affiliates will collaborate on this project with the CSU research associates. &amp;#9679; Provide office space and other material support (computer, GPS equipment, travel) for the recipients. &amp;#9679; Provide the needed data and equipment to allow the researchers to perform their work and publish the products to university affiliates, partners, and the public. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award. The justification must address one or more of the following criteria as well as discussion of the program legislative history, unique capabilities of the proposed recipient, and cost-sharing contribution offered by the proposed recipient, as applicable. In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria: (1) Unsolicited Proposal &amp;#191; The proposed award is the result of an unsolicited assistance application which represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach which is not the subject of a current or planned contract or assistance award, but which is deemed advantageous to the program objectives; (2) Continuation &amp;#191; The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation of an activity presently being funded, and for which competition would have a significant adverse effect on the continuity or completion of the activity; (3) Legislative intent &amp;#191; The language in the applicable authorizing legislation or legislative history clearly indicates Congress&amp;#191; intent to restrict the award to a particular recipient of purpose; (4) Unique Qualifications &amp;#191; The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon a variety of demonstrable factors such as location, property ownership, voluntary support capacity, cost-sharing ability if applicable, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications; (5) Emergencies &amp;#191; Program/award where there is insufficient time available (due to a compelling and unusual urgency, or substantial danger to health or safety) for adequate competitive procedures to be followed. The National Park Service did not solicit full and open competition for this award based the following criteria: (2) CONTINUATION SINGLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD This is a Task Agreement (P14AC01476) under Cooperative Agreement (P14AC00728) in the amount of $659,210.00 with a period of performance from date of award until 08/31/2015. &amp;quot;This proposed project between Colorado State University and the NPS is authorized to go through the Rocky Mountains CESU at the negotiated overhead rate of 17.5% because it passes the test of substantial involvement by the NPS, public purpose and consistency with the mission of the CESU Network&amp;quot;. Also, on the SF 424 forms that the partner sponsored programs office fills out for each project, requires a CFDA number - 15.945, which is the number associated with the CFDA Title: COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND TRAINING PROGRAMS - RESOURCES OF THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE (CESU). STATUTORY AUTHORITY A. 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167;1g authorizes the NPS to enter into cooperative agreements that involve the transfer of NPS appropriated funds to state, local and tribal governments, other public entities, educational institutions, and private nonprofit organizations for the public purpose of carrying out National Park Service programs. B. 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167;1a-2(j) Cooperative research and training programs authorizes the NPS to enter into cooperative agreements with public or private educational institutions, states, and their political subdivisions, for the purpose of developing adequate, coordinated, cooperative research and training programs concerning the resources of the national park system. Pursuant to such agreements, the cooperator may accept from or make available to the NPS technical and support staff, financial assistance for mutually agreed upon research projects, supplies and equipment, facilities, and administrative services relating to cooperative research units as the Secretary deems appropriate (research projects subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation excluded). Modified 5/31/05 &amp;#191; Agreement Handbook Memorandum Number 2 C. 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167;5933 Cooperative agreements. The Secretary is authorized and directed to enter into cooperative agreements with colleges and universities, including but not limited to land grant schools, in partnership with other Federal and State agencies, to establish cooperative study units to conduct multi-disciplinary research and develop integrated information products on the resources of the National Park System, or the larger region of which parks are a part.",

At present there is insufficient information to undertake large-scale primary and secondary LUTS prevention efforts. The primary objective of this FOA is to plan, perform and analyze the research studies necessary to establish the scientific basis for future prevention intervention studies for lower urinary tract symptoms and conditions in women. The consortium will develop the evidence base for normal or healthy bladder function and to identify behavioral and other risk factors for conditions associated with LUTS. The Consortium will focus on a broad age range from adolescent girls to older non-institutionalized women to set the stage for future research in prevention of lower urinary tract symptoms and conditions with a particular focus on symptoms that are associated with the diagnosis of bladder infections, urinary incontinence, voiding dysfunction, overactive bladder and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.",

Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms and conditions as stated in the Cooperative Agreement will apply to this Task Agreement. The focus of this task agreement is to develop, document, and maintain sea level monitoring protocols to better prepare for increasing sea levels and storm surge. Using geographic information systems (GIS) and other analysis tools, the initial focus of this project, as part of the post-Hurricane Sandy mitigation efforts, will be to install sea level monitoring equipment and associated geodetic monumentation at Fire Island National Seashore (FIIS). FIIS is situated squarely in one of the aforementioned NWLON gaps. After determining the best installation site, installing a temporary tide gauge, and collecting water level data, local tidal datums (mean high water, mean low water, etc.) can be calculated. The local tidal datums can then be used to establish a relationship with datums from nearby NWLON stations, and leverage the long-term sea level trend data from these nearby NWLON stations. This project will integrate with and provide support to several current critical NE regional projects including benthic habitat mapping, coastal elevation and bathymetry data collection, geodetic benchmark recovery and installation, and salt marsh elevation/accretion (SET) research projects. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT &amp;#9679; Provide research associates under the Principal Investigator &amp;#9679; Colorado State University researchers will participate in cooperative teams with the NPS that may be led by either party. Close working relationships with outside partners and affiliates and substantial involvement of multiple programs will be required to successfully complete this task. &amp;#9679; Provide monthly invoices paid upon receipt. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: &amp;#9679; RISD staff members and affiliates will collaborate on this project with the CSU research associates. &amp;#9679; Provide office space and other material support (computer, GPS equipment, travel) for the cooperators. &amp;#9679; Provide the needed data and equipment to allow the researchers to perform their work and publish the products to university affiliates, partners, and the public. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award.

          "Description": "The Ministry of Health (MOH) in Burma and the National Department of Health (NDOH) in Papua New Guinea (PNG) plan to rapidly expand high-quality antiretroviral treatment (ART) coverage in the coming years by increasing capacity at existing delivery sites and decentralizing selected services to provincial, district and township levels. In order to accomplish this expansion, the MOH and NDOH need strong laboratory systems that ensure high-quality HIV diagnostic and clinical monitoring of patients at the existing and new service delivery sites. This will require strengthening the capacity of Burma&amp;#146;s National Health Laboratory (NHL) and Papua New Guinea&amp;#146;s Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL), as well as building capacity of sub-national laboratories and improving the laboratory network in these countries.This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will be awarded to a technical assistance (TA) partner to provide support to NHL and CPHL in several key areas, including: (1) developing and helping implement standard operating procedures, policies, guidelines, and training materials related to management and operations of national and sub-national laboratories; (2) building capacity of NHL and CPHL staff to validate, conduct, and ensure strong (and often cross-cutting) quality assurance and monitoring systems for HIV-related diagnostic and clinical monitoring activities; (3) strengthening the overall laboratory network in Burma and PNG that may include specimen transport and right-sizing of various classes of laboratories; and (4) providing supporting mentoring of NHL and NDOH staff and opportunities for professional development. In addition, the partner will implement recommendations to support the MOH and NDOH improve HIV laboratory services at the provincial, district and township levels, and provide support to the ongoing decentralization of health services. The selected TA partner will coordinate with CDC country offices in Burma and PNG, as well as other organizations including the World Health Organization (WHO), Australian AID (DFAT), Japanese International Cooperation Agency (JICA), Clinton Health Access Initiative",

At present there is insufficient information to undertake large-scale primary and secondary LUTS prevention efforts. The primary objective of this FOA is to plan, perform and analyze the research studies necessary to establish the scientific basis for future prevention intervention studies for lower urinary tract symptoms and conditions in women. The consortium will develop the evidence base for normal or healthy bladder function and to identify behavioral and other risk factors for conditions associated with LUTS. The Consortium will focus on a broad age range from adolescent girls to older non-institutionalized women to set the stage for future research in prevention of lower urinary tract symptoms and conditions with a particular focus on symptoms that are associated with the diagnosis of bladder infections, urinary incontinence, voiding dysfunction, overactive bladder and interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome.",

This FOA invites applications from 1) institutions with NIA-funded grants in the social/behavioral sciences that are relevant to the research topics proposed under this FOA and 2) that have currently-active formal, combined MD-PhD training programs. Fields of graduate training that are responsive to this FOA are economics, health economics, demography, sociology, social epidemiology, and aspects of psychology relevant to affective science, decision science and the science of behavior change. Training programs that focus primarily on neuropsychology or clinical psychology are outside the scope of this initiative. Integrated medical and graduate research training programs may be built around single disciplines or may be multidisciplinary, may be flexible in structure, and should be consistent with individual institutional strengths. Proposed training programs should be flexible and adaptable in providing each trainee with the appropriate background in the social/behavioral sciences relevant to medicine, yet be rigorous enough to enable graduates to function independently in both basic social/behavioral science research and clinical investigation.",

The TABB FOA seeks to reduce the cost of algal biofuels. BETO?s 2019 projected state of technology (SOT) for the cost of algal biofuels is modeled at about $7 per gallon gasoline gallon equipvalent (gge) without valuable co-products. The TABB FOA will support work at bench and process development scales to develop valuable co-products, crop protection, and CO2 utilization strategies. BETO expects the TABB FOA to result in modeled algal biofuel costs of less than $5 gge by 2019. This will provide alternative, nearer-term pathways to achieve BETO?s goal of $3 gge advanced algal biofuels validation by 2030. This Notice is issued so that interested parties are aware of the EERE?s intention to issue this FOA in the near term. All of the information contained in this Notice is subject to change. EERE will not respond to questions concerning this Notice. This is a Notice of Intent (NOI) only. EERE may issue a FOA as described herein, may issue a FOA that is significantly different than the FOA described herein, or DOE may not issue a FOA at all. Once the FOA has been released, EERE will provide an avenue for potential Applicants to submit questions. NO APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED THROUGH THIS NOTICE. Please do not submit questions or respond to this Notice of Intent. Prospective applicants to the FOA should begin developing partnerships, formulating ideas, and gathering data in anticipation of the issuance of this FOA. It is anticipated that this FOA will be posted to EERE Exchange September 2014.",

          "Description": "This is a project to improve fish passage at the existing irrigation diversions on Honey Creek in the BLM Lakeview District in order to help conserve and restore the Warner sucker, redband trout, and other native fish populations in the Warner Basin. It involves generally retrofitting the diversions to provide fish passage at the sites and screen the diversion ditch to prevent fish from becoming entrained in the ditch. This agreement will be in conjunction with existing cooperative agreement No. L12AC20547. A second agreement is necessary in order to apply Secure Rural Schools-Title II funding to the project. The principal purpose of this project is to provide fish passage at the irrigation diversions on Honey Creek and to screen the associated diversion ditches, in order to conserve and restore Warner sucker, redband trout, and other native fish populations in the Warner Basin. This project will benefit the public fisheries resource by conserving important native fishes which are endemic to the Warner Basin (Warner sucker) and important to the sport fishing community (redband trout). This project is one step toward recovery of the species and potential de-listing under the Endangered Species Act.",

          "Description": "The United States (U.S.) Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) plans to support the continued increase of sustainably produced domestic bioenergy from renewable cellulosic feedstocks, such as agricultural residues, annual and perennial dedicated energy crops, and forest resources. DOE is seeking input from producers, industry, academia, research laboratories, government agencies, non-governmental organizations, environmental groups, and other bioenergy stakeholders regarding landscape design approaches that integrate cellulosic feedstock production into existing agricultural and forestry systems while maintaining or enhancing environmental and socio-economic sustainability including ecosystem services and food, feed, and fiber production. DOE is aware of promising advancements that support the objective of designing sustainable, multi-functional landscapes that supply cellulosic bioenergy feedstocks while maintaining or enhancing environmental sustainability. These advancements include the development of relevant spatial models and decision-support tools, modeling studies that demonstrate potential environmental improvements from biomass production, generation of field data on bioenergy crop and residue recovery performance and sustainability, and development of management practices for bioenergy crop and residue production. However, DOE is not aware of many initiatives that apply the current set of tools and knowledge to proactively design these multi-functional landscapes for increased cellulosic feedstock production, validate the environmental and social sustainability impacts at a watershed or comparable scale, and assess the feedstock characteristics and logistics systems (e.g., harvesting, preprocessing, and transport) associated with those landscape designs. DOE is seeking information on cost-effective, feasible approaches for testing the landscape design approach for increasing cellulosic feedstock production at a watershed, multi-landowner, or comparable spatial scale through a combination of modeling, data collection, field research, and engagement with landowners and other relevant stakeholders. This is a Request for Information (RFI) only. DOE will not pay for information provided under this RFI and no project will be supported as a result of this RFI. This RFI is not accepting applications for financial assistance or financial incentives. DOE may or may not issue a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) based on consideration of the input received from this RFI. Information on where to submit questions regarding the content of this RFI and where to submit questions regarding submission of responses can be found in the full RFI posted on the EERE Exchange website at https://eere-exchange.energy.gov.

NE funds research activities through both competitive and direct mechanisms, as required to best meet the needs of NE. This approach ensures a balanced R&amp;amp;D portfolio and encourages new nuclear power deployment with creative solutions to the universe of nuclear energy challenges. This FOA addresses the competitive portion of NE&amp;#146;s R&amp;amp;D portfolio as executed through the Nuclear Energy University Programs (NEUP), Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies Crosscutting Technology Development (NEET CTD), and Advanced Test Reactor National Scientific User Facility (ATR NSUF). NEUP utilizes up to 20 percent of funds appropriated to NE&amp;#146;s R&amp;amp;D program for university-based infrastructure support and R&amp;amp;D in key NE program-related areas: Fuel Cycle Research and Development (FC R&amp;amp;D), Reactor Concepts Research, Development and Demonstration (RC RD&amp;amp;D), and Nuclear Energy Advanced Modeling and Simulation (NEAMS). NEET CTD supports national laboratory-, university- and industry-led crosscutting research. By establishing the NSUF in 2007, DOE-NE opened up the world of material test reactors, beam lines, and post-irradiation examination facilities to researchers from U.S. universities, industry and national laboratories by granting no-cost access to world-class nuclear research facilities. In addition to the consolidation of the NSUF Call for Applications (CFA) for access to capabilities, NEUP or NEET CTD projects requiring irradiation testing and/or post irradiation examination (PIE) may include no-cost access to NSUF capabilities through a single application response to this FOA.NE reserves the right to respond to potential shifts in R&amp;amp;D priorities during FY 2015 that may be driven by events, policy developments, or Congressional/budget direction.

          "Description": "The United States and India are partnering in many areas to improve bilateral relations and bring our countries closer together. The U.S.-India partnership extends beyond only government-to-government relations to include business-to-business and people-to-people ties. One phenomenon that is deterring tourists and exchange students from coming to India, according to media reports is the threat of Gender-based Violence (GBV) against women. There have been several high-profile cases of GBV in India that include both Indian and foreign victims. Coverage of these cases has appeared in international media and become a topic of discussion in the United States, including among the academic community and lawmakers. In order to change attitudes and improve women&amp;#146;s safety, Indian NGOs increasingly are turning to online tools to create offline change. There are a handful of GBV-focused groups leading the use of Internet platforms to create crowd-sourced maps, blogs, and online campaigns. In order to expand digital literacy for NGOs working in the GBV sphere and make their work more effective, U.S. Consulate General Mumbai will hold a &amp;#147;GBV TechCamp&amp;#148; that will bring together technologists and women&amp;#146;s activists in a workshop format. The TechCamp will train participants on the different ways they can use online tools to promote women&amp;#146;s safety, raise awareness, and change attitudes.

          "Description": "The national response to the HIV epidemic in Swaziland has undergone dramatic changes and achieved major milestones up to date. As the epidemic matures in Swaziland and the country shifts from emergency response to scale-up of prevention interventions and universal access to care and treatment, the technical needs of the country are also evolving. Monitoring trends, identifying and addressing knowledge gaps, and strengthening the country&amp;#146;s long-term capacity to use epidemiological tools to produce strategic information are now recognized as important priorities moving forward. Currently, Swaziland lacks coordinated infrastructure and capacity to formulate and address research questions that will inform programmatic and policy decisions. In addition, the country needs a robust epidemiological surveillance system for communicable and non-communicable disease to enable the detection of and efficient response to disease outbreaks. The overall goal of this FOA is to strengthen the capacity of Ministry of Health (MoH) and Ministry of Economic Planning and Development (MoEPD) to produce and effectively use epidemiological, surveillance, and research data in the Kingdom of Swaziland.",

Civil society organizations are defined as: an array of non-governmental local organizations and networks (professional associations, religious organizations, community associations (local school committees, health user groups), not-for-profit organizations at national district and local levels), and has a multiplicity of potential roles in a country&amp;#145;s health response. These roles include service delivery, advocacy, health education and promotion, and as a key stakeholder that engages in planning and monitoring at multiple levels.There is limited population based data in Papua New Guinea (PNG) collected on key populations but some of the available research shows alarming risk behavior and HIV prevalence rates in key populations. One study (Askim na Save (Ask and Understand): People who sell and exchange sex in Port Moresby 2011) showed 72% of male sex worker respondents reported having commercial sex in the last 12 months used a condom with their most recent opposite sex client for anal intercourse and very concerning 17.79% of sex workers in Port Moresby who were tested, tested positive for HIV. Based on this data and others, there is enhanced focus on targeting this most affected key populations in PNG to have largest impact on curbing the HIV epidemic in country.",

Increase the capacity of local civil society organizations to be engaged and effective stakeholders in government health system planning, implementation, and review. 2. Increase the capacity and accountability of local civil society organizations to identify and address legal, policy, and structural barriers that impede equitable access to high quality HIV services for populations most at risk. 3. Increase the number of service sites that adopt dedicated approaches that offer KP friendly services without stigma and discrimination. 4. Increase the representation of community leaders, PLHIV, and key populations in the governance structures that influence health systems and health services for populations most at risk. 5. Increase the capacity of local civil society organizations to successfully secure and manage diversified funding, via host country government, donors, foundations, and the private sector. The purpose of this FOA is to serve primarily as a supplement for PEPFAR countries to support the development of or strengthening of civil society organizations: faith based organizations, regional or national networks, professional associations, or community based organizations. The intended purpose is to engage civil society in country leadership that will support and advocate for effective health systems that are transparent and reflective of the needs of key populations infected or affected by HIV/AIDS.",

          "Description": "Botswana has both a high prevalence of HIV (25% among persons 15-49 years of age) and a high incidence of TB (455 new cases per 100,000 population per year). Drug resistance is a concern with both diseases. High quality surveillance and monitoring data are needed for effective disease control efforts. This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) has two primary objectives. Both are meant to support ongoing efforts of the Botswana Ministry of Health (MOH). The first objective is to strengthen the capacity of the TB laboratory and surveillance systems focusing on drug resistance and system integration. The second objective is to a) complete the national rollout of PIMS II (Patient Information Management System) to health care facilities and development of the national data warehouse and b) to support development and implementation of an HIV surveillance strategy at national- and district-levels.",

          "Description": "The Little River is a major tributary of the Red River in southeastern Oklahoma and southwestern Oklahoma. The section of the watershed including Little River and Pond Creek National Wildlife Refuges (NWR) support one of only four extant populations of the federally endangered Ouachita rock pocketbook mussel (Arkansia wheeleri)(USFWS 2012b, 2013b) and one of only five extant populations of the winged mapleleaf mussel (Quadrula fragosa). This area also supports the recently listed rabbitsfoot (Quadrula cylindrica) (USFWS 2012a) and has been proposed as critical habitat for the rabbitsfoot. These imperiled mussels are part of a rich aquatic community inhabiting the river, which is regionally and nationally significant (Matthews et al. 2005). Protection and recovery of the Little River&amp;#191;s imperiled mussel populations requires monitoring to assess their status and the effectiveness of ongoing habitat management. This project is needed to develop a landscape-level mussel monitoring program and protocol development to verify management effectiveness and identify specific management needs for the Little River and Pond Creek NWRs. To support this effort, the goals of this project are: (1) to assess the status of imperiled mussel species in the Little River from below Pine Creek Reservoir to the Arkansas-Oklahoma state line and (2) to establish a survey protocol for monitoring the status of mussel species in the river in the future (USFWS 2013a). Final products will include a final report assessing the status of the Little River mussel community and a peer-reviewed survey protocol consistent with the Inventory and Monitoring policy. This project has been coordinated with and benefits the USFWS, Oklahoma Department of Wildlife Conservation, and the University of Oklahoma and will provide needed training to graduate students, as well as, refuge staff. USFWS staff will be substantially involved throughout the duration of this collaboration. USFWS will be actively involved in the conceptual development of this project, including identification of project objectives, selection of appropriate sampling design, data collection techniques, and analysis. USFWS staff will actively participate in data collection and oversight of data collection along with ensuring the protocol development is consistent with the Survey Protocol Handbook as per the National Inventory and Monitoring Policy. Finally, USFWS staff will review all results to determine suitability for use in guiding management activities.",

          "Description": "This is a modification to agreement number R12AP30002 awarded in on October 13, 2011 to Marsh and Associates, LLC to support the continued maintenance, expansion, and management of the Lake Mohave Native Fishes Database. This action adds $242,633.62 in additional funding to continue two additional years of project work and to extend the term of the agreement by two-years until September 30, 2016. The scope of work remains the unchanged from the original award, which is described below. The Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program (MSCP) was implemented in April 2005 to conserve 26 native species and their habitats. It is a long-term plan that geographically encompasses the river and its corridor from Lake Mead downstream to the southerly U.S. and Mexico boundary. Three fishes, humpback, bonytail and razorback sucker, are federally listed endangered species. The MSCP also maintains conservation actions for the flannelmouth sucker, a native but unlisted species that resides in portions of the lower river. A large amount of data currently exists for these fishes, and substantial amounts of new information will be acquired for all of these species with the exception of the humpback. It is the responsibility of the MSCP to manage that information for the duration of the program. The Lake Mohave [Lower Colorado River (LCR)] Native Fish Database began under the direction of P. C. Marsh and the late W. L. Minckley, Arizona State University (ASU) in 1988. Beginning in 2009 responsibility for these data transferred from ASU to Marsh &amp;amp; Associates (M&amp;amp;A) under continued direction of P. C. Marsh. Tagging of native fishes in the LCR began in the late 1970&amp;#146;s with external tags being fixed to razorbacks in Lake Mohave. Over time, native fish tagging and the native fish data base have evolved to include numerous species, tag types, and geographic locations. Current tagging protocols include the use of both wire and Passive Integrated Transponder (PIT) tags throughout the LCR corridor. As scanned, PIT tags read either 7-, 9-, or 10- character alphanumeric sequences of any possible combinations of the digits 0 through 9 and letters A through F; HDX tags that are now in the database have 7 hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F). Field data acquired by the Native Fish Work Group (NFWG) participants from bonytail, flannelmouth sucker, and repatriated (stocked) and wild adult razorback suckers are regularly generated and fish augmentation programs are expected to stock tens of thousands of native fish each year. All this data is incorporated into the native fish database, which is then accessible in a user friendly database. Database management, application and use consists of: (1) data entry from field notes and electronic stocking files for activities associated with the MSCP and its partners, (2) manipulations that organize or structure/ restructure the files, records, and their contained information, such as performance of sort routines, (3) manipulations that yield summary statistics for individuals and populations, such as days at large, change in length, and growth, (4) input to software that performs specific functions, such as mark-recapture analysis to estimate population size, (5) generation of summaries and information for reporting, and (6) capture history access via the internet. Database maintenance is labor intensive and demands meticulous control at all levels. Collection of sample data in the field is the first step to ensure completeness and accuracy of information. The recipient shall brief all field personnel in data acquisition methods and use of a standardized form/format to help towards keeping a complete record. Field data will be transmitted in original or duplicate copy to the recipient, where data are entered by keyboard into the database system. All incoming electronic files will be stored in their original condition on a computer, sorted by year and reservoir or river location, printed out, and then mated and stored with field data collection sheets. Each individual entry will be quality checked with text-to-speech software so that all database records are complete and correct relative to an original. If/when a discrepancy or other problem is detected, an attempt is to be made to make a correction. In some instances the original collector may be contacted to provide clarification or elaboration. Newer versions of the database will be regularly uploaded to a web server.",

These consequences of alcohol abuse are closely associated with profound impairment of the host innate and adaptive immune systems. The mechanisms of these immune alterations and their link with alcohol-related medical problems are, in most cases, poorly understood. The goal of this FOA is to attract applications on basic and translational research: 1) to identify how alcohol alters immune function; 2) to establish functional links between immune alterations and alcohol related infections and organ damage; and 3) to develop means for mitigating immune impairment with the goal of alleviating alcohol-induced pathology.",

NMFS is authorized to provide Federal assistance to tribes to support conservation programs for marine and anadromous species under its jurisdiction. This assistance, provided in the form of grants, can be used to support conservation of endangered, threatened, and candidate or proposed species, as well as post-delisting monitoring of recovered species. Funded activities may include development and implementation of management plans, scientific research, and public education and outreach; proposals should address priority actions identified in an Endangered Species Act (ESA) Recovery Plan or address a NMFS-identified regional priority or need. Only federally recognized tribes and organizations of federally recognized tribes, such as the Alaska Eskimo Whaling Commission, that have delegated authority to represent a federally recognized tribe on matters relating to ESA listed, candidate, or proposed species, are eligible to apply. Proposals focusing on listed, candidate, or proposed species of Pacific salmon or steelhead will not be considered for funding under this grant program; such projects may be supported through the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund. This document describes how to prepare and submit proposals for funding in fiscal year (FY) 2015 and how NMFS will determine which proposals will be funded; this document should be read in its entirety.",

IWRA is the non-profit, &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; organization that helps the US FWS to deliver the mission of the Detroit River IWR. IWRA has unique qualifications that support the allocation of GLRI funds to this project including: voluntary support capacity in the administration of GLRI funds for the construction of this project. IWRA has already successfully collected over $530,000 in funding for this project from local corporate and community partners and will work with partners to manage funds for construction of the school ship dock and fishing pier facility. The cooperative agreement of GLRI funding to IWRA will help support the design finalization, bid development, and construction of this facility. During these project phases USFWS, specifically the staff of the Detroit River IWR, will be substantially involved in daily responsibilities and decision making. USFWS will review any modifications to the existing design while construction documents are finalized, inspect one stage of completed construction before the next stage can begin, and will have the ability, with partner agreement, to halt an activity if contracted specifications are not met.",

These awards are intended to support coral reef conservation projects in shallow water coral reef ecosystems, including reefs at mesophotic depths, in American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, Florida, Guam, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and coral-dominated banks in U.S. portions of the Gulf of Mexico. Projects may be proposed in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands and the U.S. Pacific Remote Island Areas, but these locations are not considered geographic priorities under this announcement. Proposals submitted to this competition must address at least one of the following four categories: 1) Fishing Impacts; 2) Land-Based Sources of Pollution; 3) Climate Change; and 4) Local and Emerging Management Issues. Each category is described in more detail in the Federal Funding Opportunity announcement. All proposed work must be consistent with Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) National Goals and Objectives 2010-2015 (http://coralreef.noaa.gov/aboutcrcp/strategy/currentgoals/resources/3threats_go.pdf) and/or the relevant Jurisdictional Coral Reef Management Priorities (http://coralreef.noaa.gov/aboutcrcp/strategy/reprioritization/managementpriorities) developed for each of the seven states and territories. Proposals selected for funding through this solicitation will be implemented through a grant and will require a 1:1 match of non-Federal funds. Funding for this program is subject to the availability of FY 2015 Congressional appropriations and is expected to range between approximately $800,000 to approximately $1,000,000. Funding made available from NOAA&amp;apos;s Coral Reef Conservation Program is intended to support priority coral reef management activities as described in Section I(B) of this Federal Funding Opportunity announcement. Funding will be divided among the U.S. Pacific and Atlantic regions to maintain the geographic balance of the CRCP Grant Program portfolio overall, as required by the Coral Reef Conservation Act of 2000. NOAA expects that each applicant will request Federal funding at a funding level between $30,000 and $80,000 under this solicitation and that the average award size will be approximately $50,000.",

          "Description": "Joshua Tree National Park has partnered with a university to develop climate monitoring protocols for use by Citizen Scientists (also known as park volunteers). This agreement will task a Resource Assistant to implement the on-the-ground climate monitoring protocols. The Resource Assistant will work with university researchers, lead volunteers, collect data, and enter data into various databases. The Citizen Science activities will focus on conditions and trends of park resources in order to improve scientific understanding of how the flora and fauna of JOTR respond to the effects of climate change. Joshua Tree National Park has established a series of long term monitoring plots and needs assistance in gathering data for analysis to guide management and policy. The project will help create, promote, facilitate, and/or improve the public&amp;#191;s understanding of natural, cultural, historic, recreational, and other aspects of JOTR. The project will provide an opportunity for a youth to learn about the environment by spending time working on projects in JOTR.",

This announcement is to provide public notice of the National Park Service&amp;#191;s intention to fund the following project activities without full and open competition. ABSTRACT Funding Announcement P14AS00284 Project Title Historic Resource Study &amp;#191; First State National Monument Recipient Organization of American Historians Principle Investigator / Program Manager Aidan Smith Total Anticipated Award Amount $99,916.95 Cost Share None New Award or Continuation?

Created by Presidential Proclamation on March 25, 2013, First State National Monument is one of the newest additions to the 401 units of the National Park System. The proclamation describes the park&amp;#191;s purpose as the &amp;quot;preservation, protection, and interpretation of the nationally significant cultural and historic resources associated with early Dutch, Swedish, and English settlement of the colony of Delaware and parts of the colony of Pennsylvania and Delaware&amp;#191;s role in the birth of the United States and as the first state to ratify the Constitution.&amp;quot; The monument encompasses approximately 1,108 acres, and includes the Sheriff&amp;#191;s House, the Newcastle Court House and the Green in New Castle; the Dover Green in Dover; and the Woodlawn property in the Brandywine Valley of Delaware, near Wilmington, with contiguous acreage in southeastern Pennsylvania. The proclamation directs the Secretary of the Interior to prepare a management plan to preserve and protect the historic resources identified in the proclamation; to interpret the story of early Swedish, Finnish, Dutch, and English settlement, and Delaware&amp;#191;s role in the establishment of the United States; and to preserve the Woodlawn property in a manner consistent with William Bancroft Poole&amp;#191;s vision of a rural landscape accessible to the public for their health and well-being. The proclamation is based on the NPS special resource study (2008) and on an analysis of the significance of the Woodlawn property (2012). The Historic Resource Study (HRS), as defined in NPS Cultural Resource Management Guidelines (NPS-28), provides a historical overview of a park or region and identifies a park&amp;#191;s cultural resources within historic contexts. This project will prepare an HRS for First State National Monument. The study will expand the NPS&amp;#191;s provide earlier analysis of park resources and provide essential information which will inform decisions about the preservation, management, and interpretation of historic and cultural resources at the park. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT a) Produce a Historic Resource Study for First State National Monument that synthesizes all available cultural resource information from multiple disciplines in a narrative designed to serve managers, planners, interpreters, cultural resource specialists, and interested public as a reference for the history of the region and the resources within the park. b) Engage an appropriate scholars to undertake the work and act as the liaison between the NPS and the scholar(s); c) Work with NPS to develop a detailed scope of work, based on Article I of this task agreement, for the scholar(s) to follow in order to complete the Historic Resource Study; d) Ensure that the manuscript is prepared as a scholarly report meeting the standards of the historical profession and the NPS through project management, including coordination of agency and peer review comments and provision of editorial services; e) Produce an interim narrative history and analysis of extant cultural resources of the Woodlawn property no later than fifteen months after the award of this agreement; f) Produce an interim interpretive deliverable, to be defined in collaboration with the NPS and the project scholar(s) that will present contextual narratives to general and diverse audiences as a means of engaging audiences and stakeholders in the research project and in the stewardship of park resources; g) Produce the final publication quality manuscript in pdf format for purposes of internet access, plus twenty-five (25) bound copies; h) Participate in a one-day workshop with park staff and community stakeholders and the researcher to share the results of the study so that the information can be incorporated, as appropriate, into public programming at the park; i) Make the report available to its membership, as well as the public more broadly, and promote the report within its professional networks so as to make the report as widely available as possible to scholars of American History, so that those scholars and teachers may use the report&amp;#191;s findings in their teaching and writing, to the benefit of not only the scholarly community but students at many levels; j) Promote, to its membership and through its professional networks, any use by NPS of the report in its management and planning, so as to draw attention to its continued efforts to make the presentation and practice of American History within NPS as informed, current, and professional as possible, which is a core mission of the OAH. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: a.) Work with the OAH to develop a detailed scope of work, based on Article I of this task agreement, for the scholar to follow in order to complete the Historic Resource study; b.) Work with the OAH in selecting the scholar(s) to conduct the research; c.)

The primary objective of this FOA is to address barriers to astrocyte research that are due to the scarcity of tools and datasets to target and identify astrocytes rigorously. Applications should aim to transform the field of astrocyte research by generating resources that will be widely used throughout the neuroscience community. Research supported by this initiative will (i) provide new tools for manipulating and identifying astrocytes based on their heterogeneity, developmental stage or functional state; (ii) identify novel phenomic signatures and combinatorial regulatory mechanisms of astrocyte development/function that account for astrocyte diversity; (iii) characterize mechanisms by which astrocytes regulate neural circuits serving cognition, emotion and social function or contribute to abnormal neural function relevant to psychopathology.",

This document describes the coral reef conservation partnership(s) that the NOAA Coral Reef Conservation Program (CRCP) envisions, identifies the qualities that NOAA desires in a partner, and describes criteria against which applications will be evaluated for funding consideration. Partnerships selected through this notice will be implemented through a cooperative agreement of 12- to 18-months in duration. Pursuant to section 6403 of the Coral Reef Conservation Act (CRCA) (16 U.S.C. 6401 et seq), and pending Congressional appropriations, CRCP funding of approximately $700,000 is expected to be available for initiating partnership(s) with up to four non-governmental organizations in FY 2015. CRCP will consider funding either a single proposal that includes support for all seven coral reef states and territories or up to two proposals in the Pacific Islands (benefitting Hawaii, American Samoa, Guam, and/or the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) and up to two proposals in the Atlantic/Caribbean region (benefitting Florida, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands). Applications must propose a 12- or 18-month work plan, in conformance with the requirements of Section IV of this announcement, and may request between $100,000 and $700,000 (approximately $100,000 per state or territory), depending on how many of the seven coral states and territories will benefit from the proposed project(s). As required by the CRCA, recipients are required to match NOAA&amp;apos;s Federal contributions with non-Federal matching contributions at a minimum ratio of 1:1 unless the applicant is granted a waiver to the matching requirement by the agency.",

          "Description": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is soliciting proposals from eligible applicants for projects that will contribute to improved water quality in urban areas. The goal of the Urban Waters Small Grants is to fund research, studies, training, and demonstration projects that will advance the restoration of urban waters by improving water quality through activities that also support community revitalization and other local priorities. In general, projects should promote a comprehensive understanding of local water quality issues; identify and support activities that address these issues at the local level; engage, educate and empower communities surrounding the urban water body; and benefit surrounding communities including those that have been adversely impacted by the water pollution issues affecting the urban water body. The statutory authority for the cooperative agreements to be funded under this announcement is Section 104(b)(3) of the CWA, 33 USC &amp;#167;1254(b)(3). CWA Section 104(b)(3) restricts the use of these cooperative agreements to the following: conducting or promoting the coordination and acceleration of research, investigations, experiments, training, demonstrations, surveys, and studies relating to the causes, effects (including health and welfare effects), extent, prevention, reduction, and elimination of water pollution. Projects that are demonstrations must involve new or experimental technologies, methods, or approaches. EPA expects that the results of the project will be disseminated so that others can benefit from the knowledge gained in the demonstration project. A project that is accomplished through the performance of routine, traditional, or established practices, or a project that is simply intended to carry out a task rather than transfer information or advance the state of knowledge, however worthwhile the project might be, is not considered a demonstration project. For proposals that include demonstration projects, the applicant must describe how the project meets the above requirements. Implementation projects are not eligible for funding under this announcement.",

The monument encompasses approximately 11,750 acres of flat, open fields, marsh, and thick woodlands in Dorchester County, Maryland where Harriet Tubman was born, in 1822, and where she became physically and spiritually strong. After liberating herself from slavery at age 27, Tubman returned again and again to this area to help family, friends, and others to escape to freedom. Many of the places in the landscape of Tubman&amp;#191;s early life and from her quest for freedom remain within the boundaries of the monument, including Stewart&amp;#191;s Canal, the Jacob Jackson Home Site, Bucktown Crossroads, Scotts Chapel, Bazel Church, and others. Much of Tubman&amp;#191;s natal landscape is now part of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge and managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The creation of the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument followed more than a decade of community advocacy and careful study, including a Congressionally directed study to evaluate the sites&amp;#191; potential for inclusion within the National Park System. An interagency, multidisciplinary working group convened in 2008 to begin to identify key themes and stories. In addition, a scholars&amp;#191; roundtable, co-sponsored by NPS and the Organization of American Historians, convened subject matter experts to identify appropriate historical contexts for resource management and interpretation. The Historic Resource Study, as defined in NPS Cultural Resource Management Guidelines (NPS-28), provides a historical overview of a park or region and identifies a park&amp;#191;s cultural resources within historic contexts. This project will prepare a Historic Resource Study for Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument. The study will provide essential information which will inform decisions about the preservation, management, and interpretation of historic and cultural resources at the park. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT a) Produce a Historic Resource Study for Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument that provides a narrative history of the park, embracing social, political, cultural and economic themes related to the park&amp;#191;s purpose while providing accurate baseline information that will place the extant and historical resources of the park within larger historical and geographic contexts. b) Engage an appropriate scholar (or team of scholars) to undertake the work and act as the liaison between the NPS and the scholar(s); c) Work with NPS to develop a detailed scope of work, based on Article I of this task agreement, for the scholar(s) to follow in order to complete the Historic Resource study; d) Ensure that the manuscript is prepared as a scholarly report meeting the standards of the historical profession and the NPS through project management, including coordination of agency and peer review comments and provision of editorial services; e) Produce the final publication quality manuscript in pdf format for purposes of internet access, plus twenty-five (25) bound copies. f) Produce an interim interpretive deliverable, to be defined in collaboration with the NPS and the project scholar(s) that will present contextual narratives to general and diverse audiences as a means of engaging audiences and stakeholders in the research project and in the stewardship of park resources. g) Participate in a one-day workshop with park staff and community stakeholders and the researcher to share the results of the study so that the information can be incorporated, as appropriate, into public programming at the park. h) Make the report available to its membership, as well as the public more broadly, and promote the report within its professional networks so as to make the report as widely available as possible to scholars of American History, so that those scholars and teachers may use the report&amp;#191;s findings in their teaching and writing, to the benefit of not only the scholarly community but students at many levels. i) Promote, to its membership and through its professional networks, any use by NPS of the report in its management and planning, so as to draw attention to its continued efforts to make the presentation and practice of American History within NPS as informed, current, and professional as possible, which is a core mission of the OAH. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: a.) Work with the OAH to develop a detailed scope of work, based on Article I of this task agreement, for the scholar to follow in order to complete the Historic Resource study; b.) Work with the OAH in selecting the scholar(s) to conduct the research; c.) Provide the scholar(s) with access to park records, reports and databases; familiarize the scholar with the park&amp;apos;s resources and facilities; and work with the scholar to select oral history interviewees as needed; d.) Review the progress of the research to ensure relevance and quality; e.) Distribute the report and make the research available to park managers and the general public for use in management and planning; f.) Organize the one-day workshop with the OAH and the scholar(s) to present the findings of the report to park staff and stakeholders in the community g.) Share and promote the completed HRS with related and relevant NPS units. The OAH and the NPS agree to work cooperatively on the project on a regular basis for the purpose of providing guidance to the scholars(s), monitoring work, providing input, and setting or adjusting priorities.

A successful FOA respondent will support the adoption of combination prevention approaches targeting behavioral, biomedical, and structural interventions to ensure effective reach and impact on target population. Interventions aim to increase knowledge of HIV and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among KP and other priority populations, reduce sexual risk behavior, increase knowledge and access to preventive commodities among target population. Interventions will also promote HIV testing and counseling (HTC) and create demand for the uptake of HTC services by KP and OVC, increase access to HIV, STI and tuberculosis (TB) services in addition to other health care services, and support access to universal coverage of HIV treatment for all eligible PLHIV within KP and OVP. Interventions shall be carried out as part of a comprehensive package of HIV prevention interventions among KP and other priority populations, with focus on evidence-based prevention interventions (established interventions, such as volunteer male medical circumcision (VMMC); and potential future interventions, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis; diagnosis and control of sexually transmitted infections must also be considered); and establishment of a robust cascade for reach-test-treat-retain among KP and OVP.",

          "Description": "This announcement solicits applications for the National Forum for State and Territorial Chief Executives (hereinafter referred to as the National Forum) which serves as a national health policy body for the states[1] and territories. Such a forum facilitates communication among policy makers on current and emerging strategies to address common priorities, public policy and governance issues affecting states and territories. This National Forum enables the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to better leverage limited resources by improving planning and program design to complement other public and private sector initiatives serving the needs of the same populations, and to implement new programs based on legislative requirements. This competition will focus on sustaining and building upon previous projects funded through the National Forum and addressing gaps in access to health care and health care systems that continue to exist post-Affordable Care Act implementation. Within that context, the overall goals of the National Forum are to: (1) strengthen the health workforce, (2) strengthen health care delivery systems; and (3) improve access to healthcare for underserved and vulnerable populations. The National Forum cooperative agreement is multi-faceted and includes opportunities for state and territorial decision-makers to carry out initiatives that support the development and implementation of strategies related to health workforce issues, health systems, and access to healthcare. The National Forum program will address the three core functions related to the program goals and expectations: (1) facilitate collaboration among states, territories, Federal partners and other key stakeholders to achieve common goals; (2) encourage integration of public health practice, primary care delivery systems and public health infrastructures; and (3) identify and disseminate best practices and lessons learned to other states and territories. [1] &amp;#167;2(f) of the Public Health Service Act defines &amp;#191;state&amp;#191; to include, in addition to the several States, only the District of Columbia, Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands.",

This announcement is to provide public notice of the National Park Service&amp;#191;s intention to fund the following project activities without full and open competition. ABSTRACT Funding Announcement P14AS00287 Project Title River Conservation Tools and Learning Network Development Recipient River Network Principle Investigator / Program Manager Nicole Silk Total Anticipated Award Amount $25,000.00 Cost Share none New Award or Continuation? Continuation of Cooperative Agreement # P11AC00143 Anticipated Length of Agreement From date of award until09/30/2015 Anticipated Period of Performance From date of award until09/30/2015 Award Instrument Cooperative Agreement Statutory Authority 16 USC 1(g) CFDA # and Title 15.921 River, Trails and Conservation Assistance Single Source Justification Criteria Cited (2) Continuation NPS Point of Contact June Zastrow 303-987-6718 june_zastrow@nps.gov OVERVIEW Cooperative Agreement Number P13AC00143 was entered into by and between the Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS), and River Network for the purpose of working collaboratively to empower the public to protect rivers and other bodies of water by advancing watershed protection goals. Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms and conditions as stated in the Cooperative Agreement will apply to this task agreement. This task agreement outlines a multi-year partnership between NPS and River Network with the goal of developing networks and tools that are of benefit to various audiences, including national water trail managers. This collaborative effort will focus on high-priority needs of the water trails managers that are also ranked highly by the national river and watershed conservation community. Topics that rank highly for all audiences based on a comprehensive needs assessment include stimulating citizen engagement around the protection of rivers, watersheds and open spaces, and promoting financial innovation to support such conservation efforts. Although this agreement is specific to work to be funded and completed during the next year, our expectation is to continue to collaborate moving forward, subject to funding availability. Specifically, the initial year of this task agreement will focus on establishing a learning network for national water trail managers, including creating the network structure, hosting national water trails training workshop, and working with this network to develop educational materials that capture best practices and methodologies for broader application and dissemination beyond the participants of this network. These three components are broadly outlined below. A more specific work plan will be developed in the first month of this agreement and will outline activities designed to capture existing opportunities provided by other ongoing efforts, including River Network&amp;#191;s developing collaboration with the River Management Society and NPS&amp;#191;s internship program. Other subsequent phases of this agreement will be defined in future modifications that will fall under this main task. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT 1. Establish a National Water Trails Managers Learning Network that meets the needs identified through the 2014 needs assessment and is informed by River Network&amp;#191;s experience with learning networks. The structure of the Network will include an online forum that facilitates regular interactions and exchange of information/documents among water trail managers and a regular schedule of peer calls to encourage information sharing around topics identified by the participants. 2. Cooperatively with NPS, develop a strategy for phase two implementation of national water trails learning network, including support for a national water trails training workshop. 3. Provide logistical, organizational and facilitation support for national water trails training workshop to be held in the Spring/Summer 2015. 4. Administer NPS scholarship awards for attendance to the national water trails workshop in coordination with local host organization(s), pending available funding. 5. Plan, develop, and produce an educational program (e.g., webinar series, how to manual, etc.) that allows the best practices and methodologies developed through this Learning Network to have broader application and dissemination beyond this network. Priority will be given to developing tools that help entities increase public and citizen engagement around river and watershed protection, helping move members of the public along the &amp;#191;Recreation &amp;#61664; Volunteer/Supporter &amp;#61664; Engaged Citizen&amp;#191; continuum. These materials will be developed through a process that includes researching the experiences of River Network&amp;#191;s affiliates, convening trail managers to share best practices and inviting experts from outside the water recreation or environmental arena to share their experiences. In addition to citizen engagement materials, if additional staffing or intern resources are provided and resources are available during this or future task agreement periods, we will expand our focus to also include financial innovations for river and watershed protection (e.g., ballot initiatives, tax measures, water funds, etc.). NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: 1. Cooperatively with River Network, develop a strategy for the creation of a National Water Trails Managers Learning Network and its ongoing development, based on the 2014 needs assessment. 2. Provide leadership and organizational support for national water trails training workshop. 3. Provide contact and background information for the managers of the national water trails. 4. Solicit support for development of the National Water Trails Managers Learning Network from the Interagency National Water Trails team. 5. Include tasks that support NPS and River Network&amp;#191;s cooperatively held goals in work plans guiding NPS RTCA internship programs. 6. Maintain ongoing contact with River Network staff, including participating in regular monthly calls to keep staff apprised on progress on the above tasks. 7. Provide financial support to River Network to accomplish the above mentioned tasks. 8. Promote National River Rally as training and networking opportunity to RTCA and other NPS staff, national water trail managers and other members of RTCA&amp;#191;s national network.

          "Description": "The proposed agreement will support the Quechan Indian Tribe&amp;#146;s efforts to abandon a 1200-foot discharge pipeline and to complete the installation of a replacement pipeline. The existing discharge piping system is buried under a dirt parking lot, at unknown depth and location, and has surpassed its useful life. The new discharge piping system will be placed adjacent to the existing line and will be constructed with heavier gauge large-diameter piping. Abandonment and replacement of the drainage well will prevent failure, reduce seepage, resolve flooding concerns and diminish the risk of non-point source pollution caused through unintentional breakage of the existing, dilapidated discharge piping system. Recipient Responsibilities The Recipient shall carry out the Scope of Work in accordance with the terms and conditions of the proposed financial assistance agreement. The Recipient shall adhere to Federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and codes, as applicable, and shall coordinate with Reclamation on all required approvals and permits. The following are specific Recipient Responsibilities to this award: - The Recipient will manage activities associated with the installation of the new discharge piping system improvements at the site. - Prior to the work commencing, the Tribe will coordinate with Reclamation on the development of approved designs and engineering specifications. Reclamation Responsibilities Reclamation will monitor and provide federal oversight of activities performed under this Agreement. Monitoring and oversight includes review and approval of financial status and performance reports, payment requests, and any other deliverables identified as part of the Scope of Work. Additional monitoring activities may include site visits, conference calls, and other on-site and off-site monitoring activities. At the Recipient&amp;#146;s request, Reclamation may also provide technical assistance to the Recipient in support of the Scope of Work and objectives of this Agreement. Substantial involvement by Reclamation is anticipated during the performance of activities funded under this cooperative agreement. In support of this Agreement, Reclamation will be responsible for the following: - Reclamation will provide the Tribe with counsel and technical assistance in securing permits for conducting the work. - Prior to the work commencing, Reclamation will review approved designs and engineering specifications. - Reclamation will support final well abandonment efforts. - Upon completion of the work and final acceptance by the Tribe, Reclamation will complete such documents required by the Bureau of Indian Affairs to cancel, modify, and/or terminate all licenses, permits, and rights-of-way associated with the DW-4 site and the location of the portion of the existing discharge line that will be abandoned.",

          "Description": "The Office of Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR) of the Office of Science (SC), U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), hereby invites applications for basic research that represents significant advances in programming models, languages, compilers, runtime systems and tools that address fundamental challenges related to the system software stack for Exascale computing platforms (X-Stack). Programming models, languages, and related technologies that have sustained High Performance Computing (HPC) application software development for the past decade are inadequate for Exascale era computers. The significant increase in complexity of Exascale platforms due to energy-constrained, billion-way parallelism, with major changes to processor architecture, requires new energy-efficient and resilient programming techniques that are portable across multiple future machine generations. We expect to make research investments that address fundamental Exascale challenges, while offering a transition path for existing scientific applications to fully explore the challenges and rewards of Exascale platforms. Exascale programming challenges and strategies were identified in the ASCR Exascale Programming Challenges Workshop [1] and carefully captured in the workshop report [2]. Challenges and strategies related to tools for Exascale platforms were identified in the ASCR Exascale T ools Workshop [3], and captured in the workshop report [4]. Sought are complete solutions that will address multiple components of the system software stack and that will have the following characteristics: ? Scalability: enable applications to strongly scale to Exascale levels of parallelism; ? Programmability: clearly reduce the burden we are placing on high performance programmers; ? Performance Portability: eliminate or significantly minimize requirements for porting to future platforms; ? Resilience: properly manage fault detection and recovery at all components of the software stack; and ? Energy Efficiency: maximally exploit dynamic energy saving opportunities, leveraging the tradeoffs between energy efficiency, resilience, and performance.

          "Description": "Twenty-five percent of adults 15-49 years of age in Botswana are HIV-positive. Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) is one of the key prevention strategies for control of HIV. The goal of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to assist the Government of Botswana in its VMMC activities over the next 5 years. There are two main activities to be implemented. First, the awardee will a) create demand for VMMC services, b) ensure that all males seeking VMMC are offered testing for HIV, and c) conduct at least 60,000 VMMC procedures among HIV-negative males or males of unknown HIV status 13-49 years of age in three geographic areas of the country during a 5-year period (&amp;gt;4,000 procedures per site per year). There is the possibility of expansion to additional areas during the course of the award if the implementation model is successful. Second, the awardee will collaborate with the ongoing Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) which was begun in late 2013 and is scheduled to last for 5 years. This award will begin at year 1.5 of the study. The timeframe for BCPP activities in this FOA is dependent on study progression. The awardee will be prepared and able to circumcise at least 80% of HIV-negative males or males of unknown HIV status 16-49 years of age, and as many HIV-negative males or males of unknown HIV status 50-64 years of age as possible, in 15 Botswana Combination Prevention Project (BCPP) sites by the end of year 3 of the study. The awardee will then maintain these coverage levels at all 15 BCPP intervention sites for years 3-5 of the study if the VMMC component of the project is continued beyond the period planned for achieving the initial targets. For both main activities, the awardee must implement a robust system of monitoring and evaluating (M&amp;amp;E) all VMMC-related activities that is aligned with the existing national M&amp;amp;E system. There must be an emphasis on providing high quality services and meeting VMMC targets at an acceptable cost per circumcision performed.",

          "Description": "This NIH Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), supported by funds from the NIH Common Fund (Common Fund) and participating NIH Institute(s) and Center(s), invites applications for the development of human multi-cellular models that can replicate aspects of human organ physiology. Disease pathogenesis, cell-type diversity, genomic complexity, monitoring of cell to cell and cell to matrix interactions and microenvironment regulation are key aspects to be addressed by these model systems. The multi-cellular architecture will represent characteristics of the organ being modeled and will demonstrate reproducible cellular signatures and functional outputs under physiological conditions. It is anticipated that these human cell/tissue models could lead to the development and commercialization of cellular 3D modules that would eventually become part of larger organ systems targeted for rapid and high fidelity safety and efficacy evaluation of candidate therapeutics. Applications unresponsive to this FOA are those developing 3D tissues for transplantation, engineering non-human tissue models or developing simple 3D models that do not go significantly beyond those currently available and in use. Funds from the NIH will be made available through the U18 cooperative agreement award mechanism. These 2 year awards will support studies to develop multi-cellular models representative of the cellular diversity, genomic complexity, cellular architecture and function of the tissues or organs being modeled.Multi-cellular models that reflect disease pathologies including but not limited to cardiomyopathy, endocrinopathies, type 1 and type 2 diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, pancreatitis, autoimmunity, fibrosis, muscular dystrophies, neuromuscular disorders, neurodevelopmental disorders, seizures, pulmonary hypertension and cystic fibrosis are of particular interest. The NIH is collaborating with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to enable coordination of separate but parallel efforts in development of in vitro microphysiological systems as they relate to regulatory science.",

This announcement is to provide public notice of the National Park Service&amp;#191;s intention to fund the following project activities without full and open competition. ABSTRACT Funding Announcement P14AS00291 Project Title RESOURCE INVENTORY &amp;amp; CONDITION ASSESSMENT REPORT: GREAT FALLS OF THE PASSAIC/S.U.M. NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARK DISTRICT, PATERSON, NJ Recipient Organization of American Historians Principle Investigator / Program Manager Aidan Smith Total Anticipated Award Amount $25,341.47 Cost Share none New Award or Continuation? Continuation of Cooperative Agreement H2261100002 Anticipated Length of Agreement From date of award until 9/1/2016 Anticipated Period of Performance From date of award until 9/1/2016 Award Instrument Cooperative Agreement Statutory Authority 16 USC 1(g) CFDA # and Title 15.946 Cultural Resources Management Single Source Justification Criteria Cited Continuation NPS Point of Contact June Zastrow 303-987-6718 june_zastrow@nps.gov OVERVIEW Cooperative Agreement Number H2261100002 was entered into by and between the Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS), and Organization of American Historians (OAH) for the purposes of promoting the greater public and private understanding of American history for their mutual benefit and for the people of the United States as well as for future generations, so that they can enjoy the historic resources of the NPS. On April 17, 1970, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior designated the Great Falls of the Passaic/Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures Historic District in Paterson, New Jersey as a National Historic Landmark (NHL). The district was recognized as nationally significant as one of the first attempts in the United States to harness river power to industrial production when Alexander Hamilton and associates established the Society for Establishing Useful Manufactures (S.U.M.) in 1791. The S.U.M. engaged renowned engineer Pierre Charles L&amp;#191;Enfant and, after the panic of 1792, Peter Colt to construct a reservoir and raceway to power a cotton mill. During the first half of the 19th century, the S.U.M. expanded the raceway system, constructing additional canals and locks, to accommodate new factories and to facilitate river transportation, as well as a hydro-electric plant in the early 20th century. The Great Falls NHL District includes the major components of the first major hydraulic power system in the U.S., including the site of the original S.U.M. dam and raceway entrance, a second dam, the S.U.M. gatehouse, the Ivanhoe Wheelhouse, the Market Street underground raceway, the Essex Mill penstock and reservoir, the Essex Mill spillway, and the sandstone bridge spanning this spillway. A 1986 boundary expansion to the Great Falls NHL District included the Argus Mill within the district. With the decline of textile manufacturing during the 20th century, Paterson&amp;#191;s industrial infrastructure has undergone significant changes through stages of deindustrialization and revitalization. In 2011, the Paterson Great Falls National Historical Park was established to preserve and interpret resources associated with Paterson&amp;#191;s industrial past. While the park is undertaking a Historic Resource Study and an Ethnographic Overview and Assessment to inventory and evaluate cultural resources within the park&amp;#191;s boundary, an evaluation of the nationally significant resources of the Great Falls NHL District that fall outside of the park boundary is needed. This project will conduct a thorough inventory and condition assessment of all resources within the NHL District that will inform updated National Register/NHL documentation and contribute to the preservation and interpretation of these nationally significant resources. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT a. Work with the NPS Northeast Region to complete an inventory and condition assessment of cultural resources within the boundaries of the Great Falls of the Passaic/S.U.M. (Society for Useful Manufactures) National Historic Landmark District. b. Work with NPS to develop a detailed statement of work, based on Article I of this task agreement that will be used to identify appropriate scholars and task their work. c. Engage an appropriate scholar to undertake the work and act as the liaison between the NPS and the scholar; d. Ensure that the final survey and inventory manuscript is prepared as a scholarly report meeting the standards of the historical profession and the NPS through project management, including coordination of agency and peer review comments and provision of editorial services; e. Make the report available to its membership, as well as the general public, and promote the report within its professional networks so as to make the report as widely available as possible to scholars of American History, so that those scholars and teachers may use the report&amp;#191;s findings in their teaching and writing, to the benefit of not only the scholarly community but students at many levels; Promote, to its membership and through its professional networks, any use by NPS of the report in its management and planning, so as to draw attention to its continued efforts to make the presentation and practice of American History within NPS as informed, current, and professional as possible NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: a. Work with the OAH to develop a detailed statement of work, based on Article I of this task agreement, for the scholar to follow in order to complete the inventory and condition assessment report; b. Work with the OAH in selecting the scholar(s) to conduct the research; c. Provide the scholar with relevant NHL documentation, including copies of all district nominations and updates and direct the scholar to repositories for existing inventories and analyses; d. Coordinate the exchange of research materials and analyses for the scholar(s) with the principal investigators of research projects conducted by Paterson Great Falls NHP, including a Historic Resource Study and an Ethnographic Overview &amp;amp; Assessment; e. Review the progress of the research to ensure relevance and quality; f. Distribute the report and make the research available to park managers and the general public for use in management and planning; The OAH and the NPS agree to work cooperatively on the project on a regular basis for the purpose of providing guidance to the scholars(s), monitoring work, providing input, and setting or adjusting priorities. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award.

          "Description": "The Second Chance Act (SCA) of 2007 (Pub. L. 110-199) provides a comprehensive response to the increasing number of incarcerated adults and juveniles who are released from prison, jail, and juvenile residential facilities and returning to communities. There are currently over 2.3 million individuals serving time in our federal and state prisons, and millions of people cycling through local jails every year. Ninety-five percent of all offenders incarcerated today will eventually be released and will return to communities. The Second Chance Act helps to ensure that the transition individuals make from prison, jail, or juvenile residential facilities to the community is successful and promotes public safety. As part of a collaborative effort with the National Institute of Justice (NIJ) and the National Institute of Corrections (NIC), BJA seeks proposals to implement and rigorously test important criminal justice interventions and programs as part of a multi-site Demonstration Field Experiment (DFE) on prisoner reentry. The tested intervention will address motivation to change as well as criminal thinking, two areas that we need more scientific information. In addition, parole officers and service providers will work collaboratively to improve delivery of the DFE intervention. The DFE will use a randomized controlled trial research method. This multi-site DFE is part of BJA&amp;#146;s reentry activities supported with funding under the SCA. One purpose of the SCA is to generate new evidence about effective solutions for reducing recidivism among the increasing number of people who are released from jail and prison to communities as well as the subsequent challenges communities face as offenders reintegrate into society.",

          "Description": "The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&amp;#146;s Chesapeake Bay Program Office (CBPO) is announcing a Request for Proposals (RFP) for applicants to provide the Chesapeake Bay Program (CBP) non-federal partners with support for further integrating citizen-based and nontraditional environmental monitoring programs into the CBP partnership&amp;#146;s existing monitoring networks. Citizen-based monitoring programs are routine environmental data collection efforts carried out by volunteers and overseen and coordinated by a given organization. Nontraditional monitoring programs are defined here as routine environmental data collection carried out by a given organization or agency and may include local governments, conservation districts, or nongovernmental organizations (academia, river basin commissions, watershed organizations, etc.) that are currently not formally part of the CBP partnership&amp;#146;s existing monitoring networks. The integration of citizen-based and nontraditional partner monitoring programs into the CBP partnership&amp;#146;s monitoring networks will provide additional, cost-effective data and information that supports shared decision-making and adaptive management by the CBP partners focused on restoration of the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. This work includes providing technical, logistical, and outreach support for the integration of nontraditional partners&amp;#146; monitoring programs into the existing watershed and tidal monitoring networks as directed by the CBP Scientific, Technical Assessment and Reporting STAR) Team.",

This announcement is to provide public notice of the National Park Service&amp;#191;s intention to fund the following project activities without full and open competition. ABSTRACT Funding Announcement P14AS00293 Project Title PROPERTY INVENTORY AND EVALUATION: SITES POTENTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARKS LESBIAN, GAY, BISEXUAL, AND TRANSGENDER THEME STUDY Recipient Organization of American Historians Principle Investigator / Program Manager Aidan Smith Total Anticipated Award Amount $29.492.50 Cost Share none New Award or Continuation?

In June 2014, the Secretary of the Interior announced the NPS&amp;#191;s commitment to fund a Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender (LGBT) theme study as part of the NPS&amp;#191;s LGBT Heritage Initiative to explore how the legacy of lesbians, gays, bisexual, transgendered, individuals can be recognized, preserved, and interpreted for future generations. The Secretary shared news of the study during a meeting outside of the Stonewall Inn, a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in lower Manhattan, which bears testimony to the emergence of the modern gay rights movement. There, on June 29, 1969, gay patrons and their allies resisted one of many repeated police raids on the bar, asserting their rights to equal protection under the law and protesting discrimination based on sexual orientation. Though the police subdued street violence after several days, the Stonewall &amp;#191;riots&amp;#191; inspired a new spirit of activism, including the first Pride parade in New York commemorating the event&amp;#191;s first anniversary in 1970. The National Historic Landmarks Program is currently working with scholars and community advocates to develop a framework for identifying and interpreting sites which depict LBGT history and the realization of our collective vision for equal rights throughout the nation. This project will build on new and existing work about LGBT history that can serve as both contextual and evaluative tools in identifying sites associated with the interests and accomplishments of LGBT people in the greater New York area, which has served as an important cultural and political center of LGBT culture for more than a century. This project will identify new properties, as well as to identify and interpret LGBT themes at existing National Park Service and National Historic Landmark sites that connect the experiences of LGBT people to our national narrative. This inventory of sites and property analyses will identify sites for NHL designation and contribute to the preservation and interpretation of these nationally significant resources. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT a. Work with the staff in Preservation Assistance of the NPS Northeast Region to complete an inventory of sites in the greater New York area for potential NHL designation based on associations with LGBT history and to develop Letters of Inquiry to initiate formal evaluation for designation as NHLs by the National Historic Landmarks Committee of the National Parks Advisory Board; b. Work with NPS to develop a detailed scope of work, based on Article I of this task agreement that will be used to identify appropriate scholars and task their work. c. Engage an appropriate scholar to undertake the work and act as the liaison between the NPS and the scholar; d. Ensure that the final survey and evaluative essays/Letters of Inquiry are prepared as a scholarly report meeting the standards of the historical profession and of the Landmark Committee process for designating properties, including coordination of agency and peer review comments and provision of editorial services; e. Make the report available to its membership, as well as the public more broadly, and promote the report within its professional networks so as to make the report as widely available as possible to scholars of American History, so that those scholars and teachers may use the report&amp;#191;s findings in their teaching and writing, to the benefit of not only the scholarly community but students at many levels; f. Promote, to its membership and through its professional networks, any use by NPS of the report in its management and planning, so as to draw attention to its continued efforts to make the presentation and practice of American History within NPS as informed, current, and professional as possible, which is a core mission of the OAH. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: a. Work with the OAH to develop a detailed scope of work, based on Article I of this task agreement, for the scholar to follow in order to complete the inventory and condition assessment report; b. Work with the OAH in selecting the scholar(s) to conduct the research; c. Provide the scholar with relevant NHL documentation, including copies of all relevant property nominations and updates in the study area, and direct the scholar to repositories for existing inventories and analyses; d. Work with the OAH and the selected scholar to identify one to four surveyed sites for more extensive evaluation as potential NHLS; e. Review the progress of the research to ensure relevance and quality; f. Coordination submission of the report to the NHL Program (WASO) and make the research available to park managers and the general public for use in management and planning. The OAH and the NPS agree to work cooperatively on the project on a regular basis for the purpose of providing guidance to the scholars(s), monitoring work, providing input, and setting or adjusting priorities. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award.

          "Description": "Purpose. This FOA solicits Center Core grant (P30) applications from organizations with a demonstrated track record of success in conducting research in primary care PBRNs. Each successful applicant will serve as a Research Center in Practice-Based Research and Learning. These Each Center must have at least 120 primary care member practices and may either consist of 1) a primary organization with 3 or more affiliated regional PBRNs(including a PBRN affiliated with the primary organizations); or 2) be a national PBRN organized around shared resources and research infrastructure. It is expected that each Center will foster a highly collaborative, interdisciplinary research environment. By leveraging common resources, it is expected that either the consortium of PBRNs or the national PBRN will demonstrate greater productivity and will develop and conduct independent research projects more quickly than they would as separate PBRNs without a central infrastructure and collaborative partners. AHRQ is particularly interested in supporting an infrastructure that would accelerate both the generation of new knowledge and a community of learning for primary care practices to improve quality, patient safety and effectiveness of care. This funding opportunity provides no funds for specific research projects. The funds to be awarded are intended to strengthen the research and dissemination infrastructure of each Center. It is expected that as a result of this funding, Centers will be more equipped to compete for research funding from AHRQ and other funders and be better able to conduct primary care practice-based research and support quality improvement in member practices. Additionally, AHRQ intends to publish future rapid-cycle FOAs describing research projects that will be limited to funded Centers because of the cohesive infrastructure required to respond to these rapid-cycle funding opportunities.",

The Congress will share knowledge and innovation, setting the agenda for protected areas conservation for the decade to come. Building on the theme &amp;quot;Parks, People, Planet: Inspiring Solutions&amp;quot;, it will present, discuss and create original approaches for conservation and development, helping to address the gap in the conservation and sustainable development agenda. The NPS will play an important leadership role in the 2014 Congress as lead of the Responding to Climate Change stream, one of eight focus areas that will be featured at the Congress, in collaboration with the Mexican National Commission for Natural Protected Areas (CONANP) and Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, Australia (CSIRO). The Responding to Climate Change Stream will assemble tools for enabling the role of protected areas as &amp;#191;natural solutions&amp;#191; in helping communities to mitigate, adapt to, and communicate about the impacts of climate change to protected area resources and the communities that depend on them. It includes new knowledge and case studies in the field of ecosystem-based management and emphasizes the critical role of education and effective communication. Delivery of the Responding to Climate Change Stream at the World Parks Congress The NPS will partner with CSU to facilitate the effective delivery of the WPC stream, which will include identifying and coordinating speakers and moderators for plenary sessions, thirty-six 90-minute concurrent sessions, eight side events, and numerous other activities. The range of session topics will include vulnerability assessments, monitoring, forecasts and modelling, adaptation planning and implementation, roles of cultural heritage and climate change, climate literacy, and communication, and tools for climate change interpretation. CSU will commit the expertise and time of the Principal Investigator (PI), to contribute to the organization and delivery of panel discussions, workshops, side events, capacity building, and training. The PI has extensive experience in the field of climate change science and education and has conducted numerous workshops and events. He will lead a small team to support the NPS in ensuring topics delivered to the sessions represent current scientific understanding and will personally provide training on science literacy and effective communication. In addition, CSU will coordinate the services of staff to support logistics, reporting on session outcomes, and communication with WPC participants. Case studies and approaches presented during the Congress and captured by the CSU team will be delivered as a Best Practices Guidelines manual for climate change adaptation that will be launched at the Congress in consultation form and finalized in June 2015 as part of the IUCN Best Practices Guidelines series. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT 1. Provide expertise, time, and effort by the PI to review session structure, conduct science literacy training, and facilitate dialog on the use of climate science information for resource management and decision making. 2. Participate in two (2) face-to-face planning meetings to take place in August or September and October 2014. 3. The PI will attend the Congress from November 10-20, 2014. 4. Provide for the travel and services of two (2) assistants at the Congress. 5. Provide for the travel and services of one Logistical Support person. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: 1. The NPS will organize two (2) face-to-face planning meetings to take place in August or September and October 2014. 2. NPS will organize the Responding to Climate Change Stream of the World Parks Congress, including coordination of stream sessions, workshops, side events, and related activities. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award. The justification must address one or more of the following criteria as well as discussion of the program legislative history, unique capabilities of the proposed recipient, and cost-sharing contribution offered by the proposed recipient, as applicable. In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria: (1) Unsolicited Proposal &amp;#191; The proposed award is the result of an unsolicited assistance application which represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach which is not the subject of a current or planned contract or assistance award, but which is deemed advantageous to the program objectives; (2) Continuation &amp;#191; The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation of an activity presently being funded, and for which competition would have a significant adverse effect on the continuity or completion of the activity; (3) Legislative intent &amp;#191; The language in the applicable authorizing legislation or legislative history clearly indicates Congress&amp;#191; intent to restrict the award to a particular recipient of purpose; (4) Unique Qualifications &amp;#191; The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon a variety of demonstrable factors such as location, property ownership, voluntary support capacity, cost-sharing ability if applicable, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications; (5) Emergencies &amp;#191; Program/award where there is insufficient time available (due to a compelling and unusual urgency, or substantial danger to health or safety) for adequate competitive procedures to be followed. The National Park Service did not solicit full and open competition for this award based the following criteria: (2) CONTINUATION SINGLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD This is a Task Agreement (P14AC01586) under Cooperative Agreement (P14AC00728) in the amount of $51,071 with a period of performance from date of award until 12/30/2015. &amp;quot;This proposed project between Colorado State University and NPS is authorized to go through the Rocky Mountains CESU at the negotiated overhead rate of 17.5% because it passes the test of substantial involvement by the NPS, public purpose and consistency with the mission of the CESU Network&amp;quot;. Also, on the SF 424 forms that the partner sponsored programs office fills out for each project, requires a CFDA number - 15.945, which is the number associated with the CFDA Title: COOPERATIVE RESEARCH AND TRAINING PROGRAMS - RESOURCES OF THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE (CESU). STATUTORY AUTHORITY 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167;1g authorizes the NPS to enter into cooperative agreements that involve the transfer of NPS appropriated funds to state, local and tribal governments, other public entities, educational institutions, and private nonprofit organizations for the public purpose of carrying out National Park Service programs. 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167;1a-2(j) Cooperative research and training programs authorizes the NPS to enter into cooperative agreements with public or private educational institutions, states, and their political subdivisions, for the purpose of developing adequate, coordinated, cooperative research and training programs concerning the resources of the national park system. Pursuant to such agreements, the cooperator may accept from or make available to the NPS technical and support staff, financial assistance for mutually agreed upon research projects, supplies and equipment, facilities, and administrative services relating to cooperative research units as the Secretary deems appropriate (research projects subject to Federal Acquisition Regulation excluded). Modified 5/31/05 &amp;#191; Agreement Handbook Memorandum Number 2 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167;5933 Cooperative agreements. The Secretary is authorized and directed to enter into cooperative agreements with colleges and universities, including but not limited to land grant schools, in partnership with other Federal and State agencies, to establish cooperative study units to conduct multi-disciplinary research and develop integrated information products on the resources of the National Park System, or the larger region of which parks are a part.",

          "Description": "A core priority of PEPFAR is to ensure high quality, robust data are available to monitor and evaluate the national response to HIV. In Mozambique, the USG has worked closely with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and implementing partners from 2009 -2014 to strengthen health information systems in Mozambique; while progress has been made in some areas, some challenges continue: the Ministry of Health continues to have weak capacity to plan, develop, monitor, and maintain key information systems. There is inadequate human resource capacity in the public and private sector at national and subnational levels to develop and deploys health information systems. Despite expansion of some health information systems, harmonization and interoperability of these systems needs to be strengthened. The USG is working to strengthen both GRM&amp;#146;s HIV-specific information systems as well as broader program specific and sector wide health information systems that monitor MCH, malaria, nutrition, TB, mortality, and other key indicators of health. The USG aligns its support in Strategic Information to several key national SI Plans including the MOH Department of Health Information (DIS)&amp;#146;s five-year HIS strategy (2014-2019). The objective of this FOA is to strengthen local capacity and country ownership in health information systems. The primary activities include support for mortality surveillance, standardized tracking systems for monitoring patients in HIV care and treatment, assist to define e-Health architecture, training of Mozambican staff in informatics, application of data quality standards and best practices, and expansion of central Information Systems (HIS) into provincial and regional facilities.",

          "Description": "Sustaining Cultural Heritage Collections (SCHC) helps cultural institutions meet the complex challenge of preserving large and diverse holdings of humanities materials for future generations by supporting sustainable conservation measures that mitigate deterioration and prolong the useful life of collections. Libraries, archives, museums, and historical organizations across the country face an enormous challenge: to preserve collections that facilitate research, strengthen teaching, and provide opportunities for life-long learning in the humanities. Ensuring the preservation of books and manuscripts, photographs, sound recordings and moving images, archaeological and ethnographic artifacts, art, and historical objects requires institutions to implement measures that slow deterioration and prevent catastrophic loss. This work is best accomplished through preventive conservation, which encompasses managing relative humidity, temperature, light, and pollutants in collection spaces; providing protective storage enclosures and systems for collections; and safeguarding collections from theft and from natural and man-made disasters. As museums, libraries, archives, and other collecting institutions strive to be effective stewards of humanities collections, they must find ways to implement preventive conservation measures that are sustainable. This program therefore helps cultural repositories plan and implement preservation strategies that pragmatically balance effectiveness, cost, and environmental impact. Sustainable approaches to preservation can contribute to an institution&amp;#191;s financial health, reduce its use of fossil fuels, and benefit its green initiatives, while ensuring that collections are well cared for and available for use in humanities programming, education, and research.",

PEPFAR defines PPPs as collaborative endeavors that combine resources from the public sector with resources from the private sector to accomplish HIV/AIDS prevention, care and treatment goals. By leveraging private sector resources (financial and expertise), PPPs enable the U.S. government and private sector entities to enhance their efforts through jointly defined objectives, program design and implementation, and the sharing of resources, risks, and results. PPPs also help assist the sustainability of programs, facilitate scale up of interventions, strengthen country ownership, and leverage significant private sector resources. The ultimate goal of a PPP is to allow more people to benefit due to the additional resources &amp;#150; whether monetary or technical &amp;#150; brought to the partnership by the private sector organization.",

Key objectives are to increase the opportunity, capacity and motivation of mobile populations to adopt healthier sexual behaviors, increase the capacity of indigenous organizations to offer HIV prevention services to mobile populations, improve the availability and accessibility of high quality condoms, and increase access to friendly clinical and care services for HIV/STI/TB. This program will provide prevention services in 10 provinces and will target construction workers, market vendors, and agricultural workers. The implementation will be through indigenous organizations. The use of clinical mobile units will be needed to test individuals at their work site, over extended hours and multiple locations. Close coordination and collaboration with Ministry of Health (MOH) facilitates will be required.",

          "Description": "With 17% of the general population infected with HIV, Botswana has one of the highest prevalence rates in the world. Historically, the country has also had a high incidence of TB. The Government of Botswana has developed some of the strongest treatment and prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) programs in sub-Saharan Africa. As PEPFAR Botswana transitions to a technical assistance (TA) model, there is an increasing focus on the training and mentoring of health care workers to build local capacity.This FOA has five program areas related to capacity building:Program Area A: Care, support and treatment, including PMTCT, for adult and pediatric populationsProgram Area B: TB/HIVProgram Area C: LaboratoryProgram Area D: InformaticsProgram Area E: Cervical cancerAll activities will be done in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH). Training and mentoring needs are ongoing due to high staff turnover and changing international recommendations. Implementing partners should build the capacity of the MOH to provide these services without outside assistance by the end of year 5 of the cooperative agreement.",

The current annual adult HIV incidence is estimated as high as 2.4%. HIV prevalence among adults aged 18-49 years is 31% and TB incidence rate is 1380/100,000 persons. About 6,000 TB cases are expected to be diagnosed by 2015. Approximately 75-80% of TB cases are co-infected with HIV. HIV prevalence among pregnant women in Swaziland is among the highest globally at 41%. While Swaziland has made significant strides in addressing the HIV and TB dual epidemic, more effort is needed to reach universal coverage at new WHO 2013 recommended guidelines; improve delivery of quality clinical services across the entire continuum of HIV testing, care, treatment and retention such that it is seamless, comprehensive and integrated within existing structures; and increase capacity for sustainable MOH stewardship at the national, regional, and facility level. Although Swaziland has made great progress in scaling up HIV and TB clinical services, including TB/HIV collaborative activities (Intensified TB case finding (ICF), Isoniazid Preventive Therapy (IPT) and TB Infection Prevention and Control (IPC)), critical gaps and missed opportunities exist in reaching children, adolescents, and key populations (KP) with HIV services, reaching pregnant women and TB clients with ART, efficient utilization of limited resources, and strengthening structures for long term sustainability of quality-assured programs.",

          "Description": "This announcement is to provide public notice of the National Park Service (NPS), intention to fund the following project with University of Alaska Fairbanks under a Cooperative Ecosystem Studies Unit (CESU) program. CESUs are partnerships that provide research, technical assistance, and education. The project intended award is $95,561.00 in 2014. This is a continuation of an existing agreement, number P11AC90458 (P11AT36145)ending on 12/31/2015. STATUTORY AUTHORITY: Agreements Concerning Cooperative Research and Training on NPS Resources (16 U.S.C. &amp;#167; 1a-2(j)): The Secretary may enter into agreements with public or private educational institutions, States and their political subdivisions, for the purpose of developing adequate, coordinated, cooperative research and training programs concerning the resources of the National Park System, and pursuant to such agreements, to accept from and make available to the cooperator such technical and support staff, financial assistance for mutually agreed upon research projects, supplies and equipment, facilities, and administrative services relating to cooperative research units as the Secretary deems appropriate. STATEMENT OF JOINT OBJECTIVES/PROJECT MANAGEMENT PLAN: The peopling of the New World has become one of the most popular sagas of world history, capturing the attention of not only the scientific community, but indigenous communities, management agencies, and the public at large. Recent genetic, linguistic and archaeological research suggests that the Pacific Coast of North America served as one access corridor for the peopling of the New World. Researchers have posited that a contiguous environmental band, extending from Alaska to South America, facilitated migration of ancestral peoples from Asia throughout North and South America. However, our understanding of the exact location of ancient shorelines, prevailing environmental conditions, resource availability, and coastal habitation sites has been hampered by lack of, or poorly collated, data. Those data that exist are typically unpublished and/or scattered and are largely unavailable to the American public. The primary purpose of this agreement is to develop a model of Glacier Bay National Park&amp;#191;s ancient coastline by collating extant data and conducting field tests to further validate existing theories of shoreline location and morphology. This project will bring together seasoned field researchers to search existing literature, compile scattered data, and conduct field tests to validate the premises of the analysis.The purpose of this project is to develop a model of Glacier Bay&amp;#191;s ancestral coastline such that the scientific and public understanding of migration routes, settlement patterns, indigenous community kinship patterns, traditional resource uses, disease etymology, etc. is enhanced. At a local level, understanding the ancient coastal morphology and environment of Glacier Bay may assist the Tlingit nation with numerous ongoing ancestral heritage issues including locating village sites, resolving clan territorial claims, and validating and preserving oral tradition. The data compiled by this study will also identify a highly significant ecological and cultural park resource, and will make it available to better understand global climate change. Importantly, Glacier Bay National Park attracts thousands of annual visitors annually, many of whom are drawn by the areas dynamic geological history. The results of this study will be made available to international travelers interested in learning more about glaciology and ancestral human history.The successful completion of this project involves a substantial degree of cooperation between the National Park Service and the UAF researchers. The NPS archeologist and UAF researchers will work collaboratively in the field to locate, test and document remnants of ancient landscapes. Modifications to research methodologies, testing localities and other areas will be made collaboratively between the NPS and the researchers throughout the project as necessary. The researchers and NPS will jointly give presentations to park staff and the general public, conveying the results of the study as well as an appreciation and awareness of historic preservation and stewardship. The partner, in cooperation with the National Park Service will: The recipient will focus efforts on collecting geomorphological data in the field followed by analysis of data and preparation of a season report. Specific actions include: 1. UAF researchers will conduct field surveys and testing along the outer coast of Glacier Bay National Park. Following the field season, researchers will submit collected samples for AMS 14C dating, cosmogenic isotope dating, and pollen analyses. 3. UAF researchers will prepare a field season report identifying the areas surveyed, any refinements to the sampling strategy, results of tests, summarized conclusions, and recommendations for future work. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT -Substantial Involvement :The NPS archeologist will assist the UAF researchers in this cooperative research endeavor by (1) compiling (and/or making readily available) extant data and other related information on coastal geomorphology available, (2) cooperatively identify potential study sites along the coastline, (3) assisting with the development of logistical plans for accessing study sites including coordination of field research with appropriate NPS backcountry services, (4) conducting or facilitating necessary government-to-government consultations with tribal organizations, (5) interfacing between the cooperator and regional NPS Programs, (6) coordinating input of data into the NPS Archeological Sites Management Information System (ASMIS) program, (7) coordinating the NPS research permitting process, (8) cooperatively reviewing and modifying research methodologies and testing localities, and (9) reviewing and revising resulting publications, and (10) transferring the study results to NPS staff responsible for providing interpretive services to the public. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION: Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award . The National Park Service did not solicit full and open competition for this award based the following criteria: Continuation &amp;#191; The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation of an activity presently being funded, and for which competition would have a significant advere effect on the continuity or completion of the activity.This is the third season of this project.

          "Description": "This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) addresses the strong need for an electronic repository system in Rwanda. The system will be a web-based monitoring and reporting system to be used by all USG PEPFAR-funded agencies and implementing partners operating in the country, including the Rwandan Ministry of Health, the Rwanda Biomedical Center, and other PEPFAR implementing partners. An initial assessment of the existing electronic system will provide insights on whether or not maintenance, upgrade, or the development of a new platform will address the needs of PEPFAR Rwanda. A flexible and stable platform is needed and will serve as the unique repository of PEPFAR Rwanda program data at the country level. It will be used to generate PEPFAR periodic reports, including the semi-annual and annual progress reports and additional ad hoc requests. The purpose of this FOA is to develop a new system or upgrade and maintain the existing web-based reporting system that has been in place since 2008 and build local capacity within the USG team to manage and maintain the system. The system should include automated checks for data quality. In doing so, the system will add new functionality (e.g., dashboard to easily view achievement of indicators, etc.) as well as add additional data variables to be used for HIV program planning and implementation. The Division of HIV/AIDS at the Rwanda Biomedical Center (RBC) will be one of the major users of the data stored and managed on the system, and the successful applicant will be expected to work closely with this division to refine some of the data elements collected to ensure harmonization with the national system.",

          "Description": "This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) will provide funding to build an indigenous, sustainable National Health Laboratory System to support to the National HIV/AIDS Care and Treatment Plan at all health care levels in Uganda. The awardee will work to support strengthening the laboratory sector in Uganda. Despite being the entry point for HIV prevention, care and treatment, laboratory services remain the weakest link in the health care delivery system in Uganda. Many of the laboratories have poor physical infrastructure and inadequate human resources, as well as lack of quality and bio-risk management systems. There is also frequent stock out of supplies and break down of equipment due to inadequate equipment support services. Despite the presence of legislation regulating registration of laboratories and their personnel, most laboratories and personnel are not registered and do not conform to the recommended national standards. The Government of Uganda (GoU), in collaboration with Health Development Partners, is working to solve these challenges including by supporting a National Health Laboratories establishment to coordinate and manage the national laboratory network at national, regional, and district levels in both the public and private sectors.",

          "Description": "PEPFAR South Sudan collaborates closely with the Republic of South Sudan (RSS) Ministry of Health (MOH) and other key partners to implement the HIV/AIDS National Strategic Plan (NSP) and has developed a five year PEPFAR strategy for the RSS. By targeting geographic areas with high HIV prevalence, PEPFAR will assist the RSS to reach the HIV programmatic goal/tipping point of 16,000 net new HIV patients on treatment and an annual reduction of new HIV infections to below 13,000 by 2017. A primary objective to reach this goal requires improved availability and quality of HIV services for families and other high-impact populations using a public health approach. Under this funding opportunity announcement (FOA), PEPFAR South Sudan prioritizes working in collaboration with the MOH to implement the following approaches: 1) expand HIV testing and counseling (HTC) through high-yield testing approaches, 2) improve access to ART services for pregnant and breastfeeding mothers, their partners, and children, 3) strengthen pediatric HIV testing, care and treatment within a family centered approach, and 4) advance the development of a sustainable infrastructure for South Sudan&amp;#146;s workforce. This FOA solicits a combination of capacity building and mentorship for the RSS MOH at the national, state and local levels as well as through direct service delivery to complement the MOH, Global Fund and other partner efforts to scale-up HIV prevention, care and treatment programs in South Sudan.",

          "Description": "Tanzania is faced with a challenge of inadequate human resources for health (HRH), especially outside of large cities. Specifically, skills are needed to collect, analyze and manage disease and risk factor data so that this information can be used for decision making. It is estimated that Tanzania needs 225 epidemiologists (1 per 200,000 population) but currently has less than 20% of these, most of which are located at the national level. In order for Tanzania to meet its obligations for core surveillance and response, as specified in the International Health Regulations (IHR), well-trained field epidemiologists are needed. These surveillance and response capacities are needed to manage and plan HIV and AIDS, TB, malaria and other communicable and non-communicable disease programs, as well as to evaluate public health programs to inform, improve, and target appropriate health interventions. These needs are critical at the regional, district, facility and community levels where disease cases are registered, reported and collated. The first Tanzania Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (TFELTP) was launched in 2008 and started to provide needed capacity at the national and regional level. This program has grown with support from other donors and with direct government assistance. The existing TFELTP program consists of basic (3 months) and advanced (2 years) training.",

Following this evidence, countries with high HIV prevalence and low male circumcision rates were encouraged to adopt male circumcision as part of an HIV prevention comprehensive package. Malawi is a country in Southern Africa with HIV prevalence at 10.6% among the population aged 15-49 and low male circumcision rates, as only 22% males aged 15-49 report being circumcised. The majority of new infections occur among heterosexual sero-discordant, monogamous couples and among people who have multiple partners. Since Malawi adopted voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) as one component of the comprehensive package to HIV prevention, steady progress has been made in scaling up the services. To realize the 80% coverage and achieve maximum public health benefit, Malawi has a target of circumcising 2.1 million men in five years.",

          "Description": "The purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to increase population access to comprehensive HIV/AIDS services in order to decrease HIV/AIDS-associated morbidity and mortality and contribute to the successful control of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), particularly in the two provinces where CDC provides support: Kinshasa and Katanga. DRC is a vast country with 2.3 million square kilometers and 70 million inhabitants; it has a generalized HIV epidemic with an HIV prevalence of 1.1%. Access to HIV services remains limited. This FOA proposes to build on the previous five years&amp;#146; work in supporting the Ministry of Health (MOH) in the Kinshasa and Katanga provinces to expand access to quality HIV-related services. Activities include continued expansion of existing prevention interventions, including prevention of mother to child transmission of HIV (PMTCT)/B+ and HIV prevention among key populations; HIV care and treatment, including TB/HIV and sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV) services; HIV laboratory and related diagnostic services; and comprehensive monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) and quality improvement activities. Activities will also involve improvement of family-centered and community-based HIV services, as well as the implementation of user-friendly services to increase access to HIV prevention, care and treatment in the Kinshasa and Katanga provinces. This FOA will contribute in closing the gap for Ministry of Health (MOH) HIV/AIDS key priorities by increasing coverage of services in PMTCT/B+, care and support, treatment, and TB/HIV and prevention among key populations. Other outcomes include increased coverage of laboratory monitoring and improved data use for decision making and policy development. The program activities will result in reducing HIV/AIDS mortality and morbidity and decreasing the transmission of HIV in DRC.",

          "Description": "ADVANCED REACTOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT During 2012 and continuing in 2014, DOE used a Technical Review Panel (TRP) process to identify Research and Development (R&amp;amp;D) needs for viable advanced reactor concepts in order to inform DOE-NE R&amp;amp;D investment decisions. That process involved the use of a Request for Information to solicit concept information from industry and engagement of technical experts from industry, universities and National Laboratories to evaluate those concepts. Having completed this process in 2014, DOE desires to partner with industry to conduct cost-shared R&amp;amp;D for selected technology needs identified by the TRP process. The intent of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to solicit proposals to conduct such cost-shared R&amp;amp;D activities. Consistent with the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, funding in the amount of up to $12 million will be made available to fund cost-shared R&amp;amp;D with industry. This FOA is available at Fedconnect located at www.fedconnect.net under reference number DE-FOA-0001163. Applicants must register and acknowledge the FOA at fedconnect.net in order to submit questions and receive DOE notifications including responses to questions and submittals. The closing date for applications is October 7, 2014. Letters of intent are due no later than September 17, 2014. The DOE will conduct a Webinar on September 15, 2014 at 1:00 p.m. (EDT) covering project details and FOA application instructions. Webinar login instructions will be provided separately.",

The objectives are to provide pre-service and in-service training for various cadre or laboratory staff, and to equip and perform alterations and refurbishments to at least 10 laboratories to perform essential microbiology, mycobacteriology, parasitology, hematology and chemistry. The FOA will also develop laboratory information management systems (LIMS) and improve the use of generated data in decision making, increase quality by supporting laboratories to develop and adhere to quality management systems (QMS), and strengthen quality control and quality assurance. The activities of the program will include health systems strengthening by increasing human resources, implementing necessary alterations and refurbishment to physical infrastructure, improving the specimen referral system, and improving data generation and handling capabilities through an electronic information system. The program will support the Ministry of Health (MOH) of Malawi to update the National Laboratory Policy document and the national laboratory strategic plan (NLSP) as well as other guidelines that standardize the delivery of laboratory services in Malawi. The program will support the National HIV response in prevention, diagnosis, eligibility determination, and monitoring of treatment effectiveness. Activities will therefore improve scaling up of early infant diagnosis (EID), CD4 monitoring, viral load monitoring, hematology, and chemistry, as well as improving diagnosis of opportunistic infections (OIs).",

          "Description": "Recreational boating is a popular activity in the U.S. There are approximately 13 million registered boats in the U.S., and each year over 70 million people enjoy a host of water-based recreational opportunities, such as fishing, cruising, waterskiing, and spending time with family and friends. Many recreational boats are equipped with on-board toilets and wastewater holding tanks, known as Marine Sanitation Devices (MSDs). Proper disposal of recreational boat-related sewage is important in preserving and improving water quality in the country&amp;apos;s vital aquatic ecosystems. CVA provides States with Federal funding to support their ongoing efforts to improve recreational boating opportunities and provide boaters with clean, efficient facilities to prevent waste disposal into public waterways and other ecosystems. CVA is one of the Service&amp;apos;s user pay, public benefit grant programs. Excise taxes paid through motorboat fuel and sport fishing equipment purchases go into the Sport Fish Restoration and Boating Trust Fund. Approximately two percent of the trust fund is available for CVA grants each fiscal year. This year, we expect CVA to fund approximately $14 million in grants. Each year pumpouts and dump stations funded through CVA and matched with State, local, and/or private funds have a large impact on reducing the amount of potential waste in our nation&amp;apos;s waters. This has resulted in tremendous benefits such as improved water quality for public drinking water supplies, river ecosystems, and shellfish beds, convenient service for boaters on U.S. navigable waters, and boaters who are informed of how best to dispose of vessel sewage. Since the inception of CVA, the grant program has funded over 6,000 pumpouts and dump stations and has provided funds to help operate and maintain over 3,700 systems. Through dedication of the States, private marinas, the Sport Fishing and Boating Partnership Council, States Organization for Boating Access, environmental groups, and the boating public, millions of gallons of sewage have been diverted from polluting U.S. waters each year. These groups have also been instrumental in maintaining and operating the facilities in working order and providing information for the boating public regarding the importance of keeping our waters clean by using pumpout and dump stations.The program slogan is: Keep Our Water Clean - Use Pumpouts.",

          "Description": "Zambia has a 14.3% HIV prevalence among adults aged 15-49 and has had PEPFAR support for its HIV Prevention Care and Treatment Program since 2004. Part of this support has been targeted towards training and capacity building among healthcare providers, the majority of which has been in-service training. This form of training, necessitated by high staff turnover and emerging evidence which comes with changing international recommendations is costly and not sustainable. As PEPFAR support in Zambia reaches the ten year milestone, there is a need to maximize efficiencies by shifting to more sustainable and innovative training and capacity building models. In this regard, the FOA has two main components. Program Area A is the Training and Capacity building component, which will support the development of innovative, self-directed, and cost efficient training in pre-service and in-service training in the areas of 1) care, support and treatment among adult and pediatric populations, 2) TB/HIV, 3) HIV Testing and Counseling (HTC), 4) Prevention of Mother-to-Child Transmission (PMTCT) delivered on an integrated Maternal, Neonatal, and Child Health (MNCH platform), and 5) Health Systems Strengthening (HSS). The awardee will be expected to build the capacity of the Ministry of Health (MOH) and Ministry of Community Development, Mother and Child Health (MCDMCH) to independently develop, monitor, and evaluate the provision of these services by the end of year 5 of the cooperative agreement. The second component, Program Area B, is to support the national objective of achieving and sustaining at least 80% prevalence of Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC), through direct service delivery (DSD) and national level technical assistance (TA). The award will support national initiatives, including the Early Infant Male Circumcision (EIMC) implementation, as well as use of surgical devices to increase efficiencies and improve outcomes for VMMC clients in supported regions.",

          "Description": "This announcement solicits applications for the Healthy Tomorrows Partnership for Children Program (HTPCP). The goal of this program is to promote access to health care for children, youth and their families nationwide, and employ preventive health strategies through innovative community driven programs. This program supports HRSA&amp;apos;s goals to improve access to quality health care and services, to build healthy communities, and to improve health equity. HTPCP funding supports direct service projects, not research projects. HTPCP applications MUST represent either a new initiative (i.e., project that was not previously in existence) within the community or an innovative new component that builds upon an existing community-based program or initiative. HTPCP grants: 1) support the development of community-based initiatives that plan and implement innovative and cost-effective approaches to promote community identified preventive child health and developmental objectives for vulnerable children and their families, especially those with limited access to quality health services; 2) foster/promote collaboration among community organizations, individuals, agencies, businesses, and families; 3) involve pediatricians and other pediatric primary care providers (family physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants) in community-based service programs; and 4) build community and statewide partnerships among professionals in health, education, social services, government, including State Title V and Medicaid and CHIP programs, and business to achieve self-sustaining programs. A defining characteristic of HTPCP has been the sustainability of projects post Federal funding. Data indicates that 85% of HTPCP grants in 1998-2005 were partially or fully sustained after Federal funding ended (AAP, 2011). Topical areas of greatest interest for HTPCP funding include the following: early childhood development, school readiness, developmental/behavioral pediatrics, medical home (including enhanced family and youth engagement), care coordination and case management, safe sleep, oral health, mental health, school-based health, and nutrition and physical activities to address overweight/obesity. HTPCP encourages the use of innovative health information technology to increase access to a wide variety of stakeholders in communities. HTPCP also encourages strategies to support outreach and enrollment efforts to assist families to access, understand and use health insurance, including accessing preventive care services. MCHB encourages organizations to develop proposals that incorporate and build upon the goals, objectives, guidelines and materials of the Bright Futures for Infants, Children and Adolescents initiative to improve the quality of health promotion and preventive services in the context of family and community. Complete information about the Bright Futures initiative and downloadable versions of the Bright Futures Guidelines for Health Supervision of Infants, Children and Adolescents, Third Edition and other Bright Futures materials, can be found at http://brightfutures.aap.org. Bright Futures has been particularly useful to HTPCP grantees in identifying promising practice models centered on health promotion and prevention and partnering with stakeholders at the state and local levels to share lessons learned from Bright Futures and foster improvements in clinical and public health practice. HTPCP brings innovative services to communities as determined by state and local needs assessments. Projects supported by HTPCP are encouraged to partner with diverse public and private sector stakeholders to test out evidence-based practice at the community level and transform health care from the ground up. Applicants should document the potential to develop and implement new tools and products and the use of social media and other technologies for marketing and outreach. A goal of HTPCP is to build sustainable projects after Federal funding ends that will improve access to care and reduce health care costs. HTPCP investments have generated visible successes. For example, Boston Children&amp;#191;s Hospital created the Community Asthma Initiative (CAI), a comprehensive quality improvement program to provide enhanced care to pediatric asthma patients with a history of hospitalizations or emergency department visits. The program has demonstrated improved health outcomes, increased cost-effectiveness, and reduced health disparities. Hospitalizations for asthma have been dramatically cut, saving $1.46 in hospital care for every $1 spent on prevention. After the first year, asthma-related emergency room visits for children in the program plummeted 68 percent compared with emergency room trips in the year before enrollment, and there was an 85 percent drop in hospitalizations. The program is now being replicated in other states such as Alabama. Over the past 25 years, HTPCP has strengthened its commitment to serving vulnerable and at-risk populations in underserved communities. Fifty-eight percent of former HTPCP grantees reported that there was an enhancement in the cultural/linguistic competence of services in the community as a result of the program (AAP, 2011). In FY 2012, projects served over 33,000 unduplicated women, infants, children and youth, including children and youth with special health needs. In terms of race/ethnicity, nearly 70% of individuals served were from racially/ethnically diverse groups (Data from the MCHB Discretionary Grants Information System, 2014). Individuals served by HTPCP were far more likely to be from racially/ethnically diverse groups than the U.S. population in 2012, where 37% of individuals were from racially/ethnically diverse groups (United States Census Bureau, 2012).",

          "Description": "Despite the scale up of interventions among People Who Inject Drugs (PWID), HIV prevalence continues to be high in India at 7.1%. Most worrisome is the continued high HIV prevalence in the North Eastern states (NE) of Manipur (12.9%), Mizoram (12.0%) and Meghalaya (6.4%). A qualitative study (2011) carried out to assess gaps in the national PWID program revealed that PWID interventions in India and especially NE states where the epidemic lies are lagging in terms of intensity and coverage of interventions, continued barriers to accessing services, stigma and discrimination, and lack of skills in dealing with PWID among service providers. Another observation by the qualitative study is that most PWIDs have transitioned from non-injecting modes of administration (e.g., smoking or chasing heroin) to injecting (e.g., injecting pharmaceuticals or heroin). Analysis of national program data revealed that Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST) coverage in NE states was 12% (planned target 20%) and retention was also low (59%). Similarly, HIV testing coverage was also low (48%) in NE states. There is scant information on the extent of female PWID and the challenges this group faces accessing services. The estimated number of female PWID is 10,000 and they are concentrated in NE states. HIV testing facility data reveals a prevalence of 7-25% among female PWID. Similarly, HIV prevalence has been reported to be high among spouses of PWID (2.5% to 5%). There are also concerns regarding high reported spousal violence among this population (55%).",

          "Description": "Since 1970, NIST, as part of its research program, has provided funding under the Precision Measurement Grant Program (PMGP) primarily to universities and colleges so that faculty may conduct significant research in the field of fundamental measurement or the determination of fundamental constants. NIST sponsors these research projects primarily to encourage basic, measurement-related research in universities and colleges and other research laboratories and to foster contacts between NIST scientists and those faculty members of academic institutions and other researchers who are actively engaged in such work. The PMGP is also intended to make it possible for researchers to pursue new ideas for which other sources of support may be difficult to find. There is some latitude in research topics that will be considered under the PMGP. The key requirement is that the proposed project is consistent with NIST&amp;#146;s ongoing work in the field of basic measurement science (http://pml.nist.gov). Abbreviated proposals must be submitted under the PMGP in order to be considered for funding. Details of the submission process for abbreviated proposals are contained in the Full Announcement. Only proposers whose proposals have been selected by NIST as &amp;#147;finalists&amp;#148; and who have been requested by NIST to submit a full proposal are permitted to submit full proposals to NIST for the PMGP.",

          "Description": "This program supports the delivery of a wide variety of housing counseling services to homebuyers, homeowners, low- to moderate-income renters, and the homeless. The primary objectives of the program are to improve financial literacy, expand homeownership opportunities, improve access to affordable housing and preserve homeownership. Counselors provide guidance and advice to help families and individuals improve their housing conditions and meet the responsibilities of tenancy and homeownership. Additionally, counselors may provide counseling services to homeowners to prevent or resolve mortgage delinquency, default, and foreclosure, with the primary objective to preserve homeownership. Counselors provide guidance and advice to help families and individuals meet the responsibilities of homeownership and modify or refinance their loans. Counselors also help borrowers avoid inflated appraisals, unreasonably high interest rates, unaffordable repayment terms, and other conditions that can result in a loss of equity, increased debt, default, and eventually foreclosure. Counselors can also assist homeowners with inquiries related to mortgage scams, and reporting instances of potential mortgage scam victimization. Applicants funded through this program may also provide Reverse Mortgage Counseling to senior homeowners who seek to convert equity in their homes into income that can be used to pay for home improvements, medical costs, living expenses, or other expenses. FUNDING: Housing counseling funding is distributed over four applicant categories Local Housing Counseling Agencies $10,250,000, Intermediaries $25,800,000, State Housing Finance Agencies $2,800,000, and Multi-State Organizations $1,200,000.",

Dynamics and drivers exist among key populations (KPs) in Rwanda, increasing their risk of HIV infection and its transmission to the general population. This component will implement evidence-based HIV prevention interventions in KPs, comprised mainly of female sex workers (FSWs) and men who have sex with men (MSMs). Some of the interventions will target sexual partners of these populations as well. The focus will be on the identification of KPs, provision of a comprehensive package of prevention services, implementation of a Test and Link to Care (TLC) model, initiation of treatment as prevention based upon national guidelines for HIV-positive KPs, adherence counseling, and follow-up of HIV-uninfected KPs.",

          "Description": "India is home to the third largest number of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWH) in the world. There are an estimated 2.09 million people living with HIV. The Government of India (GoI) has undertaken a robust scale up of its antiretroviral treatment (ART) program, starting from eight ART centers in 2004 to over 420 centers now in 2014. Currently, over 750,000 PLWH are on ART out of 1.1 million eligible for treatment. Despite scale up success, several challenges remain for the ART program to achieve the expansion it envisages over the next five years. These include human capacity issues, loss of patients from detection to enrollment in HIV care, and late HIV detection and retention. At every stage, over 200,000 patients are lost from testing to enrollment in care, to retention in care and then to treatment. Although progress has been made in the implementation of the HIV-TB program, there are several gaps that need to be addressed. The linkages between HIV/AIDS and the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Program (RNTCP) are suboptimal, particularly in northern states due to limited capacity and infrastructure. Only 61% (2014) of TB patients were screened for HIV and knew their HIV status in the last one year. Of those identified as HIV positive, 85% were linked to ART. However, the concern is that the referral from HIV testing and care facilities to RNTCP is quite low.",

          "Description": "The goal of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) in Cameroon is to reduce HIV-related maternal and child mortality by scaling up high-quality Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) activities and strengthening treatment and care through the PMTCT platform. Specifically, it seeks to expand PMTCT coverage and improve uptake from approximately 34% to 90% in the Littoral and Center Regions of Cameroon, by integrating and scaling up PMTCT services into existing health facilities and promoting community-based PMTCT activities, including rolling out Option B+ following the national plans and guidelines. Cameroon has developed a national roll out plan. The national plan for phased-in Option B+ roll-out would cover 247 sites in the four PEPFAR-supported regions (500 sites nationwide) in 2014, 691 (1,500) sites in 2015, 1,141 (2,500) sites in 2016, and 1,379 (3,000) sites in 2017. Necessary training and site preparedness to roll out B+ would follow the same phase-in approach and would result in training 7,500 providers, including 3,447 at PEPFAR-supported sites. The model of PMTCT/ART service delivery to be implemented requires that HIV-positive pregnant women and mothers and their HIV-exposed or -infected infants receive their care and treatment at the mother-and-child unit until 24 months post-partum and then be referred to HIV care and treatment services for long-term treatment and follow-up (SDM 1). So far, only 22 sites in Cameroon where Option B+ is currently being piloted implement this model. All other sites, pending their enrollment as per the national Option B+ roll-out plan, are still implementing Option A, referring treatment-eligible pregnant women (CD4 &amp;lt; 350/mm3) to ART services to receive ART while continuing their follow-up at the MNCH service (SDM 2). Their HIV-infected children are also referred to the nearest ART site as soon as their HIV diagnosis is confirmed. These sites will switch to SDM1 in line with the B+ roll-out.",

PARC is a coalition of Federal and State agencies, tribes, organizations, and industry groups who have agreed to contribute to the PARC mission &amp;#191;to conserve amphibians, reptiles, and their habitats as integral parts of our ecosystem and culture through proactive and coordinated public/private partnerships.&amp;#191; The NPS along with ten other federal agencies, entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with PARC in October of 2011. One objective of PARC is the &amp;#191;development of procedures, practices, and programs that promote conservation of amphibians and reptiles and that reduces risks or averts threats.&amp;#191; The NPS currently funds the Federal Agencies Coordinator for PARC position under its fixed costs and travel cap. The objectives of this agreement are to: &amp;#191; Provide capacity-building training for inventory and monitoring of amphibians and reptiles, habitat management to benefit amphibians and reptiles, and wetland restoration, and to provide e-reader versions of PARC publications. &amp;#191; Improve partnership efforts with adjacent and related protected areas (federal, state, tribal, private, and international) to conserve natural resources and landscapes. Collaborate with ARC to contribute to advancing knowledge and/or increasing practical skills with regard to natural resource management, as well as fostering partnerships and information exchange among governments, agencies, and nongovernmental organizations. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT 1. Administer NPS funds to implement training in inventory and monitoring of amphibians and reptiles, habitat management to benefit amphibians and reptiles, and wetland restoration, as well as development of e-reader versions of some PARC publications. 2. Ensure proper planning, management and completion of the projects detailed in this agreement via ARC&amp;#191;s institutional, managerial, and financial capabilities. 3. Find and hire trainers appropriate for PARC training in habitat management to benefit amphibians and reptiles, inventory and monitoring of amphibians and reptiles, or wetland restoration, and will select locations for these training activities. 4. Coordinate and implement attendance opportunities for the federal agencies who are part of PARC&amp;#191;s Federal Agency Steering Committee (US Fish and Wildlife Service, NPS, US Forest Service, US Geological Survey, Bureau of Land Management, Department of Defense, Environmental Protection Agency, Farm Service Agency, National Marine Fisheries Service, Natural Resource Conservation Service) and ensure a set number of seats for federal employees. 5. Ensure that e-reader or PDF versions will be made free to federal employees (e.g., via a special code) indefinitely. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: 1. Work cooperatively (via the Federal Agency Coordinator for PARC, who is part of the Wildlife Conservation Branch of the Biological Resources Management Division) with ARC at the national, regional, and local levels to accomplish the objectives (See Article I) of this agreement. 2. Make available to ARC any suggestions from PARC&amp;#191;s Federal Agency Steering Committee. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award. The justification must address one or more of the following criteria as well as discussion of the program legislative history, unique capabilities of the proposed recipient, and cost-sharing contribution offered by the proposed recipient, as applicable. In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria: (1) Unsolicited Proposal &amp;#191; The proposed award is the result of an unsolicited assistance application which represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach which is not the subject of a current or planned contract or assistance award, but which is deemed advantageous to the program objectives; (2) Continuation &amp;#191; The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation of an activity presently being funded, and for which competition would have a significant adverse effect on the continuity or completion of the activity; (3) Legislative intent &amp;#191; The language in the applicable authorizing legislation or legislative history clearly indicates Congress&amp;#191; intent to restrict the award to a particular recipient of purpose; (4) Unique Qualifications &amp;#191; The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon a variety of demonstrable factors such as location, property ownership, voluntary support capacity, cost-sharing ability if applicable, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications; (5) Emergencies &amp;#191; Program/award where there is insufficient time available (due to a compelling and unusual urgency, or substantial danger to health or safety) for adequate competitive procedures to be followed. The National Park Service did not solicit full and open competition for this award based the following criteria: (2) CONTINUATION SINGLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD This is a Task Agreement (P14AC01611) under Cooperative Agreement (P14AC01454) in the amount of $25,000.00 with a period of performance from date of award until 09/30/2015. STATUTORY AUTHORITY 16 U.S.C. &amp;#167;1g, authorizes the NPS to enter into cooperative agreements that involve the transfer of NPS appropriated funds to nonprofit organizations for the public purpose of carrying out NPS programs.

          "Description": "Although cultures vary across the thousands of miles comprising North and South America, countries within the western hemisphere are constantly connected by sea and air creatures alike as they trek their journeys across hundreds of miles of water and terrain. From the Arctic to Antarctica, migratory species are vital ecological and economic resources shared by the nations and inhabitants of the Western Hemisphere. They are sources of food, means of livelihood and recreation, and they have important biological, cultural, and economic values for society. Despite their great value, many migratory species are endangered in the Western Hemisphere due to overexploitation, water pollution, the alteration and destruction of their breeding and wintering habitats, illegal trade, use of pesticides and, more recently, climate change. Since migratory species do not recognize borders, the conservation of these species and their habitats and migration routes can only be achieved through joint efforts of the Western Hemispheres nations. No single local organization can take on the entire responsibility of ensuring the protection and conservation of these migratory species homes, homes-away-from-homes, and everything in between, wildlife agency directors and other senior officials created the Western Hemisphere Migratory Species Initiative (WHMSI) to facilitate international cooperation. WHMSI is a regular forum for the conservation of migratory wildlife in the hemisphere. This is a notice of intent to award a grant to The Organization of American States (OAS). This grant is being awarded without competition under 505 DM2(4), unique qualifications - The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based on a variety of demonstrable factors such as location; property ownership; voluntary support capacity; cost-sharing ability, if applicable; technical expertise; or other such unique qualifications. Competition for this award is not pratical because OAS is the depository for the western hemisphere convention as stated under current bylaws, and is the mechanism of implementation under which WHMSI operates. As a result, they are uniquely qualified to provide the strategic framework and management duties for WHMSI.",

          "Description": "The Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) executes the Department of Defense (DoD) Procurement Technical Assistance Program by awarding cost sharing cooperative agreements to assist states, local governments, private nonprofit organizations, tribal organizations and economic enterprises in establishing or maintaining procurement technical assistance centers (PTACs) pursuant to Chapter 142 of title 10, United States Code. The Solicitation for Cooperative Agreement Applications (SCAA) issued July 7, 2010 is amended to allow acceptance of applications for new programs in fiscal year (FY) 2012. For FY 2012, new applications will only be considered from entities proposing to provide service to an area that will not be covered by an existing program. Applications proposing to duplicate any portion of the service area of an existing program will neither be accepted nor considered. Amendment No. 004 is not applicable to existing programs that have already received a base period award in FY 2011 under the amended solicitation. As of the issue date of Amendment No. 004, significant areas not covered or expected to become uncovered in FY 2012 include, but may not be limited to, the States of Washington, North Dakota and Rhode Island, and Washington DC. There are also uncovered regional areas (i.e., counties), but those areas have not been listed. Any entity contemplating submitting an application under this amendment, including those that propose to service an area identified, must first submit the inquiry discussed in Amendment No. 004 to ascertain if the proposed area is covered. Funding of new programs for FY 2012 is contingent on the availability of funds. In addition, awards may not be made to all acceptable applicants. Award decisions will optimize the use of program funds while at the same time maximizing the availability of procurement technical assistance. DLA will make funding decisions on a case-by-case basis and in the best interest of the overall program. An award decision for any application submitted pursuant to this amendment will be made prior to October 1, 2012. The SCAA issued on July 7, 1010 and Amendment Nos. 001 - 004 are available at http://www.dla.mil/SmallBusiness/Pages/SCAA.aspx. Additional details regarding this opportunity are provided in Amendment No. 004. Printed copies are not available for distribution. Applications must be submitted to DLA by 5 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on January 31, 2012. Notwithstanding any other provision in the SCAA or in previous Amendments, late applications will be neither accepted nor evaluated.",

          "Description": "This announcement solicits applications for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) formula grant program, established by the Affordable Care Act (ACA), to continue the delivery of voluntary early childhood home visiting program services in response to a statewide needs assessment. This program is being undertaken as part of the shared commitment of the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) and the Administration for Children and Families (ACF) to comprehensive family services, coordinated and comprehensive voluntary statewide home visiting programs, and effective implementation of high-quality evidence-based practices. The MIECHV formula grant program is designed to: (1) strengthen and improve the programs and activities carried out under Title V of the Social Security Act; (2) improve coordination of services for at-risk communities; and (3) identify and provide comprehensive services to improve outcomes for families who reside in at-risk communities. The statute reserves the majority of funding for the delivery of services through use of one or more evidence-based home visiting service delivery models. In addition, it supports continued innovation by allowing up to 25 percent of funding paid to the entity for a fiscal year to be used for service delivery through promising approaches that do not yet qualify as evidence-based models. Note: To ensure that the required statutory distribution is maintained, HRSA requires that all MIECHV programs demonstrate that they are being delivered in conformity with the approved service delivery models. This fidelity is demonstrated by programs that have the requisite designation and/or approval from a model developer to provide evidence-based home visiting services. MIECHV-funded programs must maintain the requisite designation and/or approval from the model developer while receiving MIECHV funding. Since the inception of the MIECHV program, states have been required to ensure substantial involvement in the project planning, implementation, and evaluation by representatives of the agencies listed below: &amp;#183; Director of the state&amp;#191;s Title V agency; &amp;#183; Director of the state&amp;#191;s agency for Title II of the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA); &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s child welfare agency (Title IV-E and IV-B), if this agency is not also administering Title II of CAPTA; &amp;#183; Director of the state&amp;#191;s Single State Agency for Substance Abuse Services; &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Child Care and Development Fund (CCDF) Administrator; &amp;#183; Director of the state&amp;#191;s Head Start State Collaboration Office; and &amp;#183; The State Advisory Council on Early Childhood Education and Care authorized by 642B(b)(1)(A)(i) of the Head Start Act. To ensure that home visiting is part of a continuum of early childhood services, HRSA and ACF also strongly urge states to seek consensus from: &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) Part C and Part B Section 619 lead agency(ies); &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Elementary and Secondary Education Act Title I or state pre-kindergarten program; and &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Medicaid/Children&amp;#191;s Health Insurance program (or the person responsible for Medicaid Early Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) Program). The state is encouraged to coordinate this application to the extent possible with: &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Domestic Violence Coalition; &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Mental Health agency; &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Public Health agency, if this agency is not also administering the state&amp;#191;s Title V program; &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s identified agency charged with crime reduction; &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Temporary Assistance for Needy Families agency; &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program agency; and &amp;#183; The state&amp;#191;s Injury Prevention and Control (Public Health Injury Surveillance and Prevention) program (if applicable). ACA Outreach and enrollment activities are tied to benchmarks 1, 5, and 6 (see http://mchb.hrsa.gov/programs/homevisiting/ta/resources/guidanceoct2012.pdf). To support their accomplishment of these benchmarks, MIECHV programs should assist families in enrolling in expanded health insurance coverage, using clinical preventive services and accessing primary health care, and providing information to families regarding the ACA consumer protections. Working closely with Title V MCH Directors and State Medicaid Directors, MIECHV State Project Directors should ensure that Home Visitors have the state-specific information necessary to connect individuals with Navigators (Federally-facilitated Marketplace) or Non-Navigator Assistance Personnel (State based Marketplace or State Partnership Marketplace) and Certified Application Counselors. These Navigators and Non-Navigator assistance personnel play a vital role in helping consumers prepare electronic and paper applications in order to establish eligibility. This includes steps to help the individual find out if they qualify for insurance affordability programs such as premium tax credits, cost sharing reductions, Medicaid, or CHIP. Certified Application Counselors will provide many of the same tasks as Navigators and Non-Navigator assistance personnel, including educating consumers and helping them complete an application for coverage.",

          "Description": "The purpose of this announcement is to solicit applications for the Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV) Competitive Grant program. Competitive Grants provide funds to eligible entities that are states and certain territories that continue to make significant progress under the MIECHV program towards implementing a high-quality home visiting program as part of a comprehensive, high-quality early childhood system and are ready and able to take effective programs to scale to address unmet need.[1] Grantees will use the funds to provide ongoing support to high-quality evidence-based home visiting programs and for the incremental expansion of evidence-based home visiting programs funded, in whole or in part, by the MIECHV program to achieve greater enrollment and retention of families eligible for home visiting. Additionally, this funding opportunity will continue the program&amp;#191;s emphasis on rigorous research by grounding the proposed work in relevant empirical literature and by including requirements to evaluate work proposed under this grant. Priority for Serving High-Risk Populations and Programmatic Areas of Emphasis As directed in the authorizing legislation,[2] successful applicants will give priority to providing services under the MIECHV program to the following populations: a) Eligible families who reside in communities in need of such services, as identified in the statewide needs assessment required under subsection 511(b)(1)(A). b) Low-income eligible families. c) Eligible families who are pregnant women who have not attained age 21. d) Eligible families that have a history of child abuse or neglect or have had interactions with child welfare services. e) Eligible families that have a history of substance abuse or need substance abuse treatment. f) Eligible families that have users of tobacco products in the home. g) Eligible families that are or have children with low student achievement. h) Eligible families with children with developmental delays or disabilities. i) Eligible families who, or that include individuals who, are serving or formerly served in the Armed Forces, including such families that have members of the Armed Forces who have had multiple deployments outside of the United States.&amp;#191; All applications should address increasing capacity, enrollment, and retention in high-risk communities identified in the statewide needs assessment, including those currently served through state or Federal home visiting programs. For this purpose, the following programmatic areas of emphasis have been identified. Applicants should address one or more of these areas in response to this funding opportunity announcement: &amp;#183; Emphasis 1: Improvements in maternal, child, and family health &amp;#183; Emphasis 2: Effective expansion of evidence-based home visiting programs or systems, with fidelity to the evidence-based model selected &amp;#183; Emphasis 3: Development of statewide or multi-state home visiting program innovations that effectively increase enrollment and retention &amp;#183; Emphasis 4: Development of comprehensive early childhood systems that span the prenatal-through-age-five continuum &amp;#183; Emphasis 5: Outreach to high-risk and hard-to-engage populations &amp;#183; Emphasis 6: Development of a family-centered approach to home visiting &amp;#183; Emphasis 7: Outreach to families in rural or frontier areas &amp;#183; Emphasis 8: The development of fiscal leveraging strategies to enhance program sustainability Note: Fidelity is defined as a grantee&amp;#191;s adherence to model developer requirements for implementation. These requirements include all aspects of initiating and implementing a home visiting model, including, but not limited to: recruiting and retaining clients, providing initial and ongoing training, supervision, and professional development for staff, establishing a management information system to track data related to fidelity and services, and establishing an integrated resource and referral network to support client needs. Changes to an evidence-based model that alter the components related to program outcomes could undermine the program&amp;#191;s effectiveness. Such changes (otherwise known as &amp;#191;drift&amp;#191;) will not be allowed under the funding allocated for evidence-based models. Adaptations that alter the core components related to program impacts may be funded with funds available for promising approaches if the state wishes to implement the program as a promising approach instead of as an acceptable adaptation of an evidence-based model. Per the authorizing legislation, grantees may expend not more than 25 percent of the amount of the grant awarded to an entity for a fiscal year for purposes of conducting a program using a service delivery model that qualifies as a promising approach; therefore, the majority of grant funds awarded for a fiscal year (i.e., formula and competitive funds combined) must be used to conduct activities that apply evidence-based home visiting models. For a more detailed description of each area of emphasis, please see Appendix A: MIECHV Programmatic Emphasis Areas. [1] The intention here is to maintain or incrementally expand existing home visiting programs which have proven to be effective, to eligible families or communities.

          "Description": "NPS, working with government agencies, universities, and private not-for-profit organizations, has designed a process and developed protocols for monitoring long-term ecological integrity of national park ecosystems in the North Coast and Cascades Network (NCCN) of national parks of the Pacific Northwest. The NCCN consists of three large natural area parks (Mount Rainier, North Cascades, and Olympic National Parks) and four smaller cultural and historical parks (Ebey&amp;#146;s Landing National Historical Reserve, Fort Vancouver National Historic Site, Lewis and Clark National Historical Park, and San Juan Island National Historical Park) in western Washington and Oregon. Breeding populations of landbirds have been identified as an important indicator of changes in ecological condition of these park units, and have been selected for long-term monitoring. This action originally announced on Grants.gov as P14AS00079 and is herein modified. The Institute of Bird Populations (IBP) has a lengthy history of working with the National Park Service to inventory avifauna in park units throughout the country. In 2000, the Institute began working directly with NCCN parks, first, by working with North Cascades National Park to summarize recommendations of an expert panel for developing a spatially extensive inventory and monitoring program in North Cascades National Park (Siegel and Kuntz, 2000). Subsequently, the NCCN adapted those recommendations and established a cooperative agreement with the Institute to conduct large-scale avian inventories in North Cascades, Olympic, Mount Rainier, and San Juan Islands. The Institute completed fieldwork for these avian inventories in 2004 (Siegel et al. 2002, 2004a, 2004b, 2005a, 2005b). Consequently, the Institute has become the leading expert in conducting avian inventories and monitoring programs in national parks of the NCCN. In October 2003, the Institute entered into a 3-year cooperative agreement with US Geological Survey to help the NCCN develop a Landbird Monitoring Plan that included a peer-reviewed monitoring protocol and a manual of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). A draft protocol and SOPs were written and peer-reviewed in summer/fall of 2006. Implementing this protocol enabled NCCN parks to track and understand how avian communities and their habitats respond to natural processes, to distinguish differences between human-induced disturbance effects and those caused by natural processes, to provide early detection of environmental impairment, and to provide park managers with comprehensive, scientifically-based information about the nature and status of selected biological resources occurring within park boundaries in a form that increases its accessibility and utility for making management decisions, for scientific research, and for educating the public. The National Park Service will award this task to the Institute of Bird Population based on the following exception - Unique Qualifications - IBP is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon demonstrated factors, specifically, location, technical expertise, and other unique qualifications as outlined in this document. The National Park Service, North Cascades National Park, intends to award a Modification to Task Agreement (TA) P14AC01123 to provide for additional avian studies in fiscal year 2015 based upon this announcement and the receipt of additional funding after the original Task Order was awarded in April 2014. Presently, a five year Cooperative Agreement is in place for avian monitoring and related services, this TA is to fund the following: Pre-season planning for monitoring in FY 15. Revise Landbird protocol methods and SOPs based on recommendations in the published the synthesis report.",

          "Description": "The National Historical Publications and Records Commission seeks proposals that use cost-effective methods to digitize nationally significant historical record collections and make the digital versions freely available online. Projects must make use of existing holdings of historical repositories and consist of entire collections or series. The materials should already be available to the public at the archives and described so that projects can re-use existing information to serve as metadata for the digitized collection. To make these projects as widely useful as possible for archives, historical repositories, and researchers, the applications must demonstrate: 1. The national significance of the collections or records series to be digitized; 2. An effective work flow that repurposes existing descriptive material, rather than creating new metadata about the records; 3. Reasonable costs and standards for the project as well as sustainable preservation plans for the resulting digital records; 4. Well-designed plans that evaluate the use of the digitized materials and the effectiveness of the methods employed in digitizing and displaying the materials. Projects may not use grant funds to create * descriptive metadata or * edited transcriptions of the digitized materials or * develop websites where people will have to pay a fee to view the images. For a comprehensive list of Commission limitations on funding, please see &amp;#147;What we do and do not fund&amp;#148; (http://www.archives.gov/nhprc/apply/eligibility.html). A grant normally is for one to three years and up to $150,000. The Commission expects to make up to 8 grants in this category, for a total of up to $700,000. The Commission requires that grant recipients acknowledge NHPRC grant assistance in all products that result from its support. Eligible applicants: * Nonprofit organizations or institutions * Colleges, universities, and other academic institutions * State or local government agencies * Federally-acknowledged or state-recognized Native American tribes or groups Applicant organizations must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to submitting an application, maintain CCR registration throughout the application and award process, and include a valid DUNS number in their application. Details on CCR registration and requesting a DUNS number can be found at the Central Contractor Registration website. Ineligible applications will not be considered. Cost sharing is required. It is the financial contribution the applicant pledges to the cost of a project. Cost sharing can include both direct and indirect expenses, in-kind contributions, non-Federal third-party contributions, and any income earned directly by the project. The NHPRC will provide up to 50 percent of the total project costs.",

          "Description": "Human resources (HR) are an essential component of Zimbabwe&amp;#146;s health system, and are therefore critical for an effective response to the HIV epidemic. Still recovering from the effects of the political crisis in the first decade of the 21st century, the country&amp;#146;s health institutions are understaffed and the workforce overburdened. Efficient information systems can provide knowledge to equitably distribute scarce human resources. This includes both applications to manage information about the health sector workforce and means to electronically share information across systems. This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) will build on past and current CDC-supported activities at the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MOHCC) and the Health Professional Regulatory Bodies. Original funding started in Fiscal Year (FY) 2009 with Emory University and a local information technology (IT) company recording business process requirements and software design. In October 2011, Health Informatics Training and Research Advancement Centre (HITRAC), a unit within the University of Zimbabwe, took over and developed a new human resources information system (HRIS) that since April 2013 has been successfully deployed to all 8 provincial MOHCC human resources (HR) departments, 2 central hospitals, and the MOHCC head office. New systems have also been developed and deployed for the Nursing Council of Zimbabwe (NCZ), Medical Dental Physician Council of Zimbabwe (MDPCZ), and Medical Laboratory and Clinical Scientists Council of Zimbabwe (MLSCZ), with appropriate staff trained by HITRAC, and strong engagement from all the stakeholders. Deployment to the other four central hospitals and four Regulatory Councils was scheduled for later in 2013.",

          "Description": "The purpose of this FOA is to provide technical assistance (TA) to the Government of Kenya (GOK) and implementing partners in strengthening their capacity to design and implement systems to collect, analyze, interpret and disseminate high quality HIV data. To achieve this, the awardee(s) will complete activities under the following program areas: Program Area A &amp;#150; Surveillance and Epidemiology: Support the GOK and its partners in strengthening their capacity to design, implement, analyze, disseminate, and use data from epidemiologic studies to adequately and accurately measure outcomes and impact, while informing decision making and policy in the national and sub-national HIV response. Epidemiologic studies will include surveillance, surveys, operations research/implementation science and public health impact evaluations. Program Area B &amp;#150; Monitoring and Evaluation: Strengthen the Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;amp;E) capacity of health workers in program data collection, analysis and reporting as well as cohort analysis and program evaluation. The support will also include review, revision and roll out of M&amp;amp;E framework, tools, policies and standard operating procedures (SOPs), M&amp;amp;E coordination and collaboration at national and sub-national levels and support strengthening quality of HIV data through training and mentorship. Program Area C &amp;#150; mHealth: The third component will entail supporting the GOK units such as the National AIDS and STI Control Program (NASCOP), National Public Health Laboratory Services (NPHLS) and Kenya Medical Supplies Agency (KEMSA) in mobile technology innovations (mHealth) projects that leverage mobile technologies to enhance efficiencies in the delivery of prevention, care and treatment of HIV. PEPFAR resources have been used previously to support mHealth activities such SMS-based transmission of Early Infant Diagnosis (EID), health commodities management, adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and Peer Education at the Pump Project (PEPP), tracking of key populations, blood donor data management, remote data collection for surveys and mLearning. The awardee of the mHealth component of this FOA is expected to build on the existing achievements and scale up the scope of application through innovative solutions that will also complement facility-based Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems by providing mobility to health care workers and provide solutions in transmitting secured patient level records from community and facilities to national and sub-national levels. The awardee will ensure sustainable capacity building for the GOK staff through the provision of training and mentorship in mHealth systems development, management, use, and maintenance.Evaluations will be conducted through-out the award period to show evidence of the achievement of short and long term goals of each of the three components of this funding opportunity announcement.",

          "Description": "The National Historical Publications and Records Commission seeks proposals to publish historical records of national significance. Projects may focus on the papers of major figures from American life or cover broad historical movements in politics, military, business, social reform, the arts, and other aspects of the national experience. The historical value of the records and their expected usefulness to broad audiences must justify the costs of the project.Grants are awarded for collecting, describing, preserving, compiling, editing, and publishing documentary source materials. Because of the focus on documentary sources, grants do not support preparation of critical editions of published works unless such works are just a small portion of the larger project.All applicants should be aware that the application process is highly competitive. A top priority of the Commission is to support projects with plans to provide free online access to the editions they are preparing.A publishing project that has received NHPRC support can apply for a grant for a new or subsequent stage of that project. Such projects may plan editions on print, microfilm, or other media. In any case, they must present plans for online publication of their editions, including methods of providing free access. These plans need not include provision for the retrospective conversion of material already published. Applicants that have received NHPRC grants in the past must demonstrate that their ongoing projects have successfully achieved the performance objectives associated with previous NHPRC awards. Proposals must be substantially updated, including a description of the new activities, progress towards preparing online editions, and a justification of the new budget. Applicants not previously funded may apply for a grant to begin a historical documents publishing project. These applications are considered with other proposals. Although they may publish in other media, the initial focus of these projects must be on the preparation of online editions.The NHPRC does not fund proposals to purchase historical records; nor does it fund proposals to publish the papers of anyone who has been deceased for fewer than ten years. For a comprehensive list of Commission&amp;apos;s limitations on funding, please see What We Do and Do Not FundApplicants may apply for funding for up to three years, but should be aware that the Commission normally awards grants on an annual basis; subsequent funding is conditioned on project&amp;#146;s previous years&amp;apos; performance. Award amounts ordinarily range from $20,000 to $250,000 annually. Depending on the availability of funding, the Commission expects to make as many as 30 grants in this category, for a total of up to $2,500,000.In accordance with Federal regulations, the Commission reserves, for Federal Government purposes, a royalty-free, non-exclusive, and irrevocable license to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work and authorize others to reproduce, publish, or otherwise use the work that results from each grant. The Commission requires that grant recipients acknowledge NHPRC grant assistance in all publications and other products that result from its support. Eligible applicants: * United States nonprofit organizations or institutions * Colleges, universities, and other academic institutions * State or local government agencies * Federally-acknowledged or state-recognized Native American tribes or groups Applicant organizations must be registered in Central Contractor Registration (CCR) prior to submitting an application, maintain CCR registration throughout the application and award process, and include a valid DUNS number in their application. Details on CCR registration and requesting a DUNS number can be found at the Central Contractor Registration website. Ineligible applications will not be considered.Cost sharing is required. Cost sharing is the financial contribution the applicant pledges to the cost of a project. Cost sharing can include both direct and indirect expenses, in-kind contributions, non-Federal third-party contributions, and any income earned directly by the project. The Commission ordinarily provides no more than 50 per cent of total project costs for Publishing Historical Records projects.",

Subsequent to providing pre-development grant funding to the selected applicants, HUD will assess the impact of the availability of such funding on the ability of project Sponsors to expedite the development processing of projects from Section 202 Fund Reservation to Initial Closing within 18 months. HUD is aware of the complexities of developing Section 202 projects and understands that a lack of pre-development funding may be a contributing factor in many instances where project Sponsors are not able to move their approved projects from Fund Reservation award to Initial Closing within the required 18-month time frame. Funding under this program is not intended to duplicate Section 202 Capital Advance funding, but rather to provide a source of funding for pre-development costs that would otherwise not be reimbursable until Initial Closing or would be payable from eligible funding resources secured outside of Section 202 Capital Advance funding.",

This announcement is to provide public notice of the National Park Service&amp;#191;s intention to fund the following project activities without full and open competition. ABSTRACT Funding Announcement P14AS00335 Project Title Tobin Harbor National Register Nomination Recipient Organization of American Historians Principle Investigator / Program Manager Aidan Smith Total Anticipated Award Amount $29.492.50 Cost Share none New Award or Continuation?

Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms and conditions as stated in the Cooperative Agreement will apply to this Task Agreement. The objective of this task agreement is to document, to National Register of Historic Places standards, the Tobin Harbor Historic District at Isle Royale National Park in Michigan as described in the National Park Service 2011 Cultural Landscape Inventory (CLI) and to complete National Register Documentation for this historic district. This National Register evaluation of Tobin Harbor will provide a regional comparative analysis of similar water-borne property types&amp;#191;remote North Woods/Great Lakes family seasonal resorts/camps on large bodies of water&amp;#191;and nominate the Tobin Harbor district at a regional level of significance if justified by the regional analysis. This project assists in the promotion, facilitation, and improvement of people&amp;#191;s understanding of the historic properties associated with the modern, recreation history in the United States of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. It will demonstrate the regional historic context of a national pattern of recreation and will consider the ability of modest vernacular historic properties to demonstrate this regional manifestation of the national story. The information, products and/or services identified or developed by this project will potentially be shared by associated partners of the national park through a variety of strategies to increase public awareness, knowledge and support for historic preservation and stewardship of the Tobin Harbor Historic District and its level of significance within the western North Woods and Great Lakes region. Tobin Harbor is a small resort community composed of twelve private camps and a fishery scattered on several islands at the northeast end of the Isle Royale archipelago in Lake Superior. The total number of camps declined over the years, and the National Park Service removed a number after the establishment of the park. Many of the remaining Tobin Harbor camps retain their original outbuildings and other associated structures. Although additions and repairs have been made over the decades, many of the properties retain a high degree of integrity. The CLI identified a period of significance for the resort community as 1900 &amp;#191; 1939, when Tobin Harbor was a vital summer community during the height of Isle Royale&amp;apos;s tourism industry and identified a local level of significance. The Tobin Harbor community evolved over time as friends, families, and others who enjoyed the rugged beauty of Isle Royale purchased property and made it their summer home. During the hey-day of the Tobin Harbor development, the Minong Lodge resort was the &amp;quot;community center&amp;quot; of the Tobin Harbor district. The rustic vernacular landscape maintains circulation, cluster patterns and historic structures through the retention of cabins, docks, outbuildings, circulation and cluster patterns, and views. Collectively, these properties comprise a historic district that retains high integrity, and express a continuum of use that began during the early 20th century. Although many of the seasonal residents no longer return, a number of camps are still used by life lease holders and their families during the summer. Several of the Tobin Harbor camps represent the families that strongly supported and advocated the Isle Royale National Park movement, and formed the Isle Royale Protective Association in the early 1930s. Involved supporters included the Merritt, Connolly, Siefert, Smith, and the Edwards families, among many others. The National Park Service and the Michigan State Historic Preservation Officers concurred that the Tobin Harbor Historic District historic landscape as defined in the CLI is eligible to the National Register, and the NPS manages this resource as a historic property. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT 1. Work with NPS to identify a researcher to prepare a NR nomination of Tobin Harbor Historic District in Isle Royale National Park, Michigan. A CLI dated 2011 prepared by the NPS, Midwest Regional Office, defines a boundary, period of significance, and a local level of significance and can be used as the foundation of the NR nomination. The nomination shall be submitted according to the format outlined in the National Register Bulletin, How to Prepare the National Registration Form (available at: http://www.nps.gov/nr/publications/bulletins/nrb16a/) and prepared on a &amp;#191;National Register of Historic Places Registration Form&amp;#191; Form 10-900. 2. Work with NPS to arrange a post award meeting with OAH, NPS, researcher, and others to discuss technical aspects of the agreement and to confirm the schedule for the submission of the products in conjunction with a public meeting to introduce the project historian(s) to members of the community. 3. Work with NPS to prepare the nomination per the attached Statement of Work. 4. Work with NPS to identify appropriate peer reviewer(s) and obtain external review. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: 1. Make available to the OAH existing CLI/List of Classified Structures reports and all resources and studies related to the Tobin Harbor Historic District at Isle Royal. This includes a Map of Isle Royale NP with an insert of the Tobin Harbor recreation camps. 2. Provide transportation and logistical assistance for site visits to Tobin Harbor and the historic resources associated with the NR nomination. 3. Provide a NPS technical representative who will serve as the liaison for this task agreement between the NPS and OAH. 4. Provide timely review of the draft and final products. This includes coordinating the draft review with the Michigan State Historic Preservation Officer and with the Isle Royale Friends and Family Association. 5. Ensure that the NR eligibility criteria are fully addressed. 6. Consult with the OAH in determining the appropriate qualifications, experiences, and skills required in the primary field project historian(s). 7. Act as a liaison to the Isle Royale Friends and Family Association. 8. Provide research assistance for materials available at the Midwest Region Office of the NPS. 9. Arrange a post award meeting to discuss technical aspects of the agreement and to confirm the schedule for the submission of the products in conjunction with a public meeting to introduce the project historian(s) to members of the community. The meeting shall take place in Illinois within 30 days of the award.

          "Description": "Synopsis of WPSP call for research proposals: The Women in Public Service Project (WPSP) aims to build a generation of women leaders who will invest in their countries and communities, provide leadership in governments, and change the way global solutions are forged. Evidence based research is one key to improving policy decisions in order to increase the presence of women in public service. The first funded research component of WPSP will provide grants for research within a total amount of 60,000 dollars. This research is intended to be used for practical applications: informing policy makers and providing input for the design of effective programs to attract, retain and advance women in public service. Applications will only be accepted from international teams that include a member from at least one ESF eligible country (see list at end of announcement.) That is, the research proposals must involve researchers in a minimum of two countries. Interdisciplinary applications are encouraged. Background on WPSP: On March 11, 2011, Secretary Clinton announced the establishment of the Women in Public Service Project (WPSP). Founded through a partnership between the Department of State and the Seven Sisters women?s colleges, WPSP creates training, mentoring and networking opportunities for aspiring women leaders. The partnership is also growing to include other academic institutions, individuals, and related organizations worldwide. As a first call to action, the State Department and the founding colleges partnered to host a Colloquium on December 15, 2011 at the Department of State, convening policy makers, public officials, academic experts, and innovative thinkers to: form a global network of women in public service; draw attention to the need to train and uplift a new generation of female political leaders; and advance partnerships, including an annual summer institute on public service and political leadership for young women. Background on the research component of WPSP: Solid, evidence-based research is one key to building support for the increased participation of women in public service and more broadly for women in political leadership. Yet there is currently a shortage of such research including research based on rigorous statistical analysis in this field. Therefore, as a further step, the State Department is now calling for research proposals and will fund a total of $60,000 of research projects related to Women in Public Service. Areas of interest include but are not limited to: the impact of women?s participation in public service; obstacles that prevent women from rising in public service and the effectiveness of various means to address these obstacles; measuring the success of various means for attracting young women to participate in public service; identifying keys to retention and advancement of women in public service. For example, more research is needed on the impact of women?s participation in public service, ie what happens in the process of government and governance when women participate, and what happens when they do not participate in government and governance? This research is intended to be used for practical purposes in providing evidence to policy makers, and designing programs that work to attract, retain and advance women in public service. Information about how the research will be shared ? including social media plans and linking to the new Women in Public Service Project Website (http://womeninpublicservice.org) ? should be included in the proposal. Details for proposal submission: Program Officer: Lora Berg, BergLJ@state.gov 202-736-7884 Eligibility requirements: a track record of successfully completed, peer evaluated research is required. Proposals should include the following information: Names and institutions of the researchers Project description (this section should include a description of the research plan, the investigators? professional vision for the project, possible project outcomes and intended audiences) Timeline Biographical sketches (not to exceed two pages each). Include biographical sketches for the researchers. Budget: the maximum award size sought, including direct and indirect costs. Cost sharing is encouraged, and if cost-sharing is envisioned, partners should be introduced here Project evaluation: All projects must have a brief evaluation plan. Proposals should be submitted via grants.gov Before using grants.gov for the first time, each organization/researcher must register to create a profile. Once registered, the applicant?s organization can then apply for any federal grant on the grants.gov website. The grants.gov?s grant community user guide is a comprehensive reference document that provides technical information about grants.gov Once all documents have been complete, the authorized organizational representative (AOR) must submit the application to grants.gov and verify the desired funding opportunity to which the application is submitted. The AOR must then sign and submit the application to grants.gov. Merit review: Proposals will be vetted by an ad hoc panel of at least five qualified individuals drawn from the Department of State, non-competing academic institutions and NGOs with proven interest in promoting women in public service. The program officer assigned to manage the proposal?s review will consider the advice of reviewers and formulate a recommendation; final decisions will be made at the Special Representative level within the Department of State. The panel will ask the following questions: 1) What is the intellectual merit of the proposed research? (How important is the proposed research to advancing knowledge and understanding of women in public service? How well qualified is the proposed team to conduct the project? To what extent does the proposed research suggest and explore creative, original or potentially transformative concepts? How well conceived, realistic and organized is the proposed research? Is there sufficient access to resources?) 2) What are the broader impacts of the proposed research? (How well does this research advance discovery and understanding of women in public service while promoting progress in areas such as teaching, training, and learning? How well does the proposed activity broaden the participation of underrepresented groups not only in terms of gender but also ethnicity, disability, faith, geographic diversity, etc? Is there a mentoring aspect to the work ? ie will graduate students or others be drawn into the project? To what extent might the research enhance networks and partnerships? Will the results be disseminated broadly enough to enhance not only scientific understanding but also public policy and institutional decisions? What may be the benefits of the proposed research to society?

          "Description": "The intent of the Breakthrough Award is to support promising research that has high potential to lead to or make breakthroughs in breast cancer. The critical components of this award mechanism are: Impact: Research supported by the Breakthrough Award will have the potential for a major impact and accelerate progress toward ending breast cancer. The impact may be near-term or long-term, but must be significant and move beyond an incremental advancement. Applications must articulate the pathway to making a clinical impact for individuals with, or at risk for, breast cancer, even if clinical impact is not an immediate outcome. Research Scope: Research proposed under this award mechanism may be small- to large-scale projects, at different stages of idea and research development. Two different funding levels, based on the scope of the research, are available under this Program Announcement. Funding Levels 1 and 2 are available under a different Program Announcement (W81XWH-14-BCRP-BREAKTHROUGH2_FL12). It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (PI) to select the funding level that is most appropriate for the research proposed. The following are general descriptions, although not all-inclusive, of the scope of research projects that would be appropriate to propose under each funding level: &amp;#149; Funding Level 3: Advanced translational studies that have potential for near-term clinical investigation. Small-scale clinical trials may apply. &amp;#149; Funding Level 4: Large-scale projects that will transform and revolutionize the clinical management and/or prevention of breast cancer. Near-term clinical impact is expected. PIs are expected to have experience in successfully leading large-scale projects. Note: An invited oral presentation to the BCRP Integration Panel (IP) is a requirement for application review of Funding Level 4 projects, as described in Section II.C., Application Submission Content and Forms. Partnering PI Option: The Breakthrough Award encourages applications that include meaningful and productive collaborations between investigators. The Partnering PI Option is structured to accommodate two PIs, called the Initiating PI and the Partnering PI, each of whom will each receive a separate award. The Initiating and Partnering PIs have different submission requirements; however, both PIs should contribute significantly to the development of the proposed research project including the Project Narrative, Statement of Work (SOW), and other required components. The PIs may have expertise in similar or disparate scientific disciplines, but each PI is expected to bring distinct contributions to the application. New collaborations are encouraged, but not required. It is the responsibility of the PIs to describe how their combined expertise will better address the research question and explain why the work should be done together rather than through separate efforts. To meet the intent of the Partnering PI Option, applicants are discouraged from submitting as a Partnering PI on multiple applications unless they are clearly addressing distinct research questions.",

          "Description": "The Innovative Treatment Evaluation Award (ITEA) is intended to support the initial evaluation of a treatment or intervention in smaller, early phase or pilot clinical trials (Phase 0, I, or I/II, devices in U.S. Food and Drug Administration [FDA] Class I-III) and does not require preliminary data in a Gulf War Illness model system. The ITEA mechanism was first offered in FY09. Since then, 29 ITEA applications have been received, and 10 have been recommended for funding. The ITEA supports the early systematic evaluation of innovative interventions with the potential to impact the health and lives of veterans with GWI. The results of preliminary studies funded by this award should have the potential to provide clinical proof-of-principle data and support future development of broader efficacy studies of the proposed interventions. Innovation is an important component of the ITEA. An application may demonstrate innovation not only by investigating a novel therapeutic approach for GWI, but also by studying a treatment that may have been utilized for other chronic multi-symptom illnesses, but has not yet been studied in veterans with GWI. For example, a pharmacological treatment or nutritional supplement suggested by previous research to be beneficial for fibromyalgia or chronic fatigue syndrome could be evaluated in veterans with GWI under the ITEA. However, the focus of the research must be clearly on GWI (and veterans of the 1990-1991 Gulf War) and not on another disease process or veteran cohort. Given the emphasis on innovation in the ITEA, applications are not required to include preliminary data. If preliminary data are provided, the data do not necessarily have to come from the GWI research field. Whether or not preliminary data are included in the application, the proposed research project should be based on sound scientific rationale that is established through logical reasoning and critical review and analysis of the literature. If there is significant preliminary and preclinical data reflecting considerable development of a treatment with applicability to GWI, the application would not be deemed innovative in keeping with the intent of the ITEA. This award mechanism is designed to evaluate a broad scope of treatment approaches with potential for application for GWI. Treatment approaches may include pharmacologic or other physiological interventions, including conventional, alternative, or complementary (combination of alternative and conventional) approaches. A variety of experimental and non-experimental study designs are acceptable under this award mechanism. The proposed study design will depend on the specific treatment or intervention to be assessed, resources available to clinical investigators, and the level of evidence currently available to support the proposed treatment for GWI. Examples of potential prospective designs may include systematic case series, prospective outcome evaluation studies, small-scale randomized trials, a combination of these, or other innovative prospective methods. Also of interest are interventions based on biological alterations identified in veterans with GWI. All studies involving interventions, regardless of design, are considered clinical trials. Health outcomes of interest for the proposed trial should include effects of interventions on: &amp;#149; Global health measures (biomarkers) and/or functional status; &amp;#149; Improvements in symptom complexes (e.g., cognitive function, musculoskeletal/pain symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, fatigue, respiratory problems, skin abnormalities, sleep difficulties) individually and as they may interact with each other; &amp;#149; GWI subgroups characterized by symptom or other clinical characteristics. Applications that include partnerships with the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry that will leverage drug development efforts and accelerate the implementation of interventions for GWI are encouraged. Studies whose principal focus is on treatment of psychiatric conditions, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), will not be funded under this Program Announcement/Funding Opportunity. While Gulf War veterans are affected by Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS, also called Lou Gehrig&amp;#146;s disease) at twice the rate of veterans who did not serve in the Gulf War, the GWIRP will not accept applications focusing on ALS research. However, applications that focus on GWI symptomatology may include GW veterans with ALS if the latter disorder is included in the study&amp;#146;s GWI case definition. [For those interested in pursuing ALS-focused studies, the office of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP) has a separate ALS Research Program (see http://cdmrp.army.mil/alsrp)]. Applications must clearly indicate how GWI cases, including any targeted illness subgroups, will be defined for purposes of the study. Applicants must provide a published case definition they intend to use to define their GWI population. Any case definition must recognize the multi-symptom nature of GWI. Note: The 2014 report of the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans&amp;#146; Illnesses, Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans: Research Update and Recommendations, 2009-2013, provides information on GWI, including case definitions and research on epidemiology, etiology, pathobiology, and treatment. The 2014 report can be found online at http://www.bu.edu/sph/files/2014/04/RAC2014.pdf. In addition, the pre-publication report (available online at http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2014/Chronic-Multisymptom-Illness-in-Gulf-War-Veterans-Case-Definitions-Reexamined.aspx) released by the Institute of Medicine includes recommendations for a consensus case definition. Funding from this award mechanism must support a clinical trial and may not be used for preclinical research studies. A clinical trial is defined as a prospective accrual of human subjects where an intervention (e.g., device, drug, biologic, surgical procedure, rehabilitative modality, behavioral intervention, or other) is tested on a human subject for a measurable outcome with respect to exploratory information, safety, effectiveness, and/or efficacy. This outcome represents a direct effect on the human subject of that intervention or interaction. Principal Investigators (PIs) seeking funding for a preclinical research project should consider one of the other award mechanisms/funding opportunities being offered. The term &amp;#147;human subjects&amp;#148; is used in this Program Announcement/Funding Opportunity to refer to individuals who will be recruited for or who will participate in the proposed clinical trial. For more information, a Human Subject Resource Document is provided at https://ebrap.org/eBRAP/public/Program.htm. If the clinical trial involves the use of a drug that has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the proposed investigational use, evidence that an Investigational New Drug (IND) exemption application that meets all requirements under the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 21, Part 312 (21 CFR 312) has been submitted or will be submitted to the FDA within 60 days of award is required. If the investigational product is a device, evidence that an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE) application that meets all requirements under 21 CFR 812 has been submitted or will be submitted to the FDA within 60 days of award, or that the device is exempt from an IDE, is required. The Government reserves the right to withdraw funding if the IND or IDE application has not been submitted to the FDA within 60 days of the Department of Defense (DoD) award date or if the documented status of the IND or IDE has not been obtained within 6 months of the award date. The following are important aspects of submission for the ITEA: &amp;#149; The proposed clinical trial is expected to begin no later than 12 months after the award date or 18 months for FDA-regulated studies. &amp;#149; The proposed intervention to be tested should offer significant potential impact for veterans with GWI. &amp;#149; The proposed research project must be based on sound scientific rationale that is established through logical reasoning and critical review and analysis of the literature and the application must identify the pathobiological mechanism being targeted. &amp;#149; The application should describe the planned indication for the product label, if appropriate, and include an outline of the development plan required to support that indication. &amp;#149; PIs must demonstrate availability of and access to a suitable Gulf War veteran population that will support a meaningful outcome for the study. Discuss how accrual goals will be achieved and how standards of care may impact the study population. PIs are encouraged to collaborate with an investigator who has demonstrated access to a population of ill and healthy Gulf War veterans, particularly investigators within the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). &amp;#149; The application should demonstrate documented availability of and access to the drug/ compound, device, and/or other materials needed, as appropriate. The quality of the product should be commensurate with FDA manufacturing standards applicable to the type and phase of product being developed (i.e., Quality System Regulation, Good Manufacturing Practices). &amp;#149; The proposed clinical trial design should include clearly defined and appropriate endpoints, and follow Good Clinical Practice (GCP) guidelines. &amp;#149; The application should include a clearly articulated statistical analysis plan, appropriate statistical expertise, and a power analysis reflecting sample size projections that will clearly answer the objectives of the study. &amp;#149; The application should include a clearly articulated data management plan, and use of an appropriate database to safeguard and maintain the integrity of the data. &amp;#149; The application should include a clearly articulated safety management plan. &amp;#149; The application should include a clearly articulated clinical monitoring plan, outlining how the study will be monitored for GCP compliance, if applicable. &amp;#149; The application should include a study coordinator(s) who will guide the clinical protocol through the local Institutional Review Board (IRB) of record and other regulatory approval processes, coordinate activities from all sites participating in the trial, and coordinate participant accrual. &amp;#149; The application should include a Transition Plan (including potential funding and resources) showing how the product will progress to the next clinical trial phase and/or delivery to the market after the successful completion of the GWIRP ITEA. &amp;#149; The application should clearly demonstrate strong institutional support. &amp;#149; The application should acknowledge the commitment to filing the study in the National Institutes of Health (NIH) clinical trials registry, www.clinicaltrials.gov.",

As part of this strategy, funding is available for capacity-building activities that include Proof of Concept Centers and Commercialization Centers as well as scaling of existing commercialization programs and centers; feasibility studies for the creation and expansion of facilities such as science and research parks; and supporting opportunities to close the funding gap for early-stage companies. To that end, EDA&amp;#146;s existing and highly successful i6 Challenge is being joined by additional grant opportunities to create the Regional Innovation Strategies (RIS) Program. Under this program, EDA is soliciting applications for three separate competitions: 1. 2014 i6 Challenge; 2. Science and Research Park Development Grants; and 3.

          "Description": "USDOL/ILAB intends to award up to $10 million for multiple cooperative agreements to organizations to implement impact evaluations globally to expand the evidence base on child labor and forced labor. Applicants may submit proposals to cover the cost of a full impact evaluation, to request supplemental funding for ongoing evaluations, or for additional analysis on completed evaluations, including survey costs. In general, USDOL would expect proposed full evaluations to range in cost from approximately $250,000 to $1 million; requests for supplemental funding for ongoing evaluations, including support of a survey, to range in cost from approximately $10,000 to $250,000; and requests for supplemental funding for additional analysis on completed evaluations to range in cost from approximately $10,000 to $50,000. It should be noted that these guidelines are not absolute; proposals for impact evaluations must describe and justify the level of funding for each evaluation or additional analysis being requested. Applications must propose impact evaluations outside of the United States that address key evidence gaps regarding child labor or forced labor program interventions in the areas outlined in this solicitation, and must demonstrate how they would leverage partnerships with implementing organizations to build upon existing, planned or completed interventions and/or impact evaluations, or secure separate funding for the intervention(s) itself. Subgrants may be made to academics or academic institutions, and study results may be published independently after the cooperative agreement has closed. Applicants may propose multiple studies. Funding through this cooperative agreement must only be used to fund impact evaluation design, implementation, analysis, and dissemination and must not be used to fund projects or interventions. Proposed impact evaluations must: 1) provide evidence that will be relevant to informing the design and effectiveness of a project or government policy that has direct or indirect effects on child labor or forced labor; 2) utilize partnerships between researchers, contractors, and/or non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and local organizations in the country where the proposed impact evaluation will take place; 3) ensure that impact evaluation results will be available within the time-period of the cooperative agreement; 4) build the evidence base on child labor or forced labor in OCFT&amp;#146;s intervention areas and/or outcomes of interest; 5) test interventions or combinations of interventions; 6) examine interventions that are relevant and promising; 7) ensure that study designs, surveys, and analysis conform to international and national definitions and standards on child labor and forced labor; and 8) use RCT designs.",

          "Description": "This announcement solicits applications for the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Partnership for State Title V Maternal and Child Health (MCH) Leadership Community Cooperative Agreement. The purpose of this cooperative agreement is to support an organization focusing on MCH to improve public health programs and the delivery of MCH services and assure optimal alignment with the transformed Title V MCH Services Block Grant program. The awardee will support efforts of State Title V MCH programs, led by State MCH and Children with Special Health Care Needs (CSHCN) Directors, to improve the health of all mothers and children by assisting States in developing, implementing, and sustaining public health programs and a comprehensive system of care for the delivery of MCH services that are well aligned with the transformed Title V MCH Services Block Grant. In addition, the awardee will support efforts of State Title V MCH Services Block Grant programs related to the implementation of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), including outreach and enrollment, tracking improvements from coverage to care to systems, and developing an &amp;#191;early warning system&amp;#191; for ACA-related issues in MCH. Applications for the Partnership for State Title V MCH Leadership Community Cooperative Agreement must address the following four goals: 1. Assist and support State MCH and CSHCN Directors in improving MCH outcomes; 2. Serve as an effective voice in communicating the importance of MCH issues; 3. Develop strong partnerships and collaborations with other national partners to advance MCH priorities; and 4. Facilitate development of a highly skilled MCH workforce, including State MCH leaders and staff, family leaders, and youth leaders. This funding will assist in providing an effective link between the Health Resources and Services Administration&amp;#191;s (HRSA&amp;#191;s) Maternal and Child Health Bureau (MCHB), State Title V MCH programs, and MCH-related organizations at the national level to improve each State&amp;#191;s ability to demonstrate the impact and value of the Title V MCH Services Block Grant. This funding also will support closer linkages between State Title V MCH programs and other HRSA and non-HRSA investments, including, but not limited to, Maternal, Infant, and Early Childhood Home Visiting (MIECHV), Healthy Start, newborn screening, Early Childhood Comprehensive Systems (ECCS), Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC), community health centers, and the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC).",

          "Description": "This announcement solicits applications for the Rural Health Care Services Outreach Grant Program (Outreach Program). ORHP&amp;#191;s Outreach Program is a community-based program targeted to improve outreach and service delivery in local and regional rural communities. The goals for the Outreach Program are the following: 1. Expand the delivery of health care services to include new and enhanced services exclusively in rural communities 2. Deliver health care services through a strong consortium, in which every consortium member organization is actively involved and engaged in the planning and delivery of services 3. Utilize and/or adapt an evidence-based or promising practice model(s) in the delivery of health care services 4. Improve population health, demonstrate health outcomes and sustainability Proposed projects will have an outcomes-oriented approach that will enhance and sustain the delivery of effective health care in rural communities. Proposed projects will be grounded in an evidence-based or promising practice model(s) in order to avoid &amp;#191;reinventing the wheel&amp;#191;. Projects based on an evidence-based or promising practice model have shown to be effective in addressing the community&amp;#191;s need, improving the health status of its residents and sustaining the project beyond Federal funding. Outreach projects can take the framework or methodology of an evidence-based or promising practice model and tailor it to their community&amp;#191;s need and organization. Evidence-based programs are those that are developed from scientific evidence and/or have been found to be effective based on the results of rigorous evaluations.[1] &amp;#191;A &amp;#191;promising model&amp;#191; is defined as one with at least preliminary evidence of effectiveness in small-scale interventions or for which there is potential for generating data that will be useful for making decisions about taking the intervention to scale and generalizing the results to diverse populations and settings&amp;#191;.[2] An example of a promising practice is a small-scale pilot program that generates positive outcome results and justifies program expansion to new access points and/or service populations. Programs funded have varied greatly and have brought care to at least two million rural citizens across the country who would otherwise not receive care or have access to care. The community served must be involved in the development and ongoing operations of the program in order to appropriately address the needs of the target population. Through consortia of local providers and others, rural communities have managed to develop innovative approaches to challenges related to enhancing access to services, adapting to changes in the health care environment, and improving the health of their communities. This includes projects focused on the full range of needs in rural communities from workforce, post-acute care services, long-term care services, public health enhancement, and care coordination. As health care increasingly moves toward a focus on enhancing value in health care delivery, applicants are encouraged to develop innovative approaches to help their rural communities improve the health of their local population. Applicants should think about how their proposed project addresses the goals of the Outreach grant program and how their project addresses a community need (which should be based on a community needs assessment). The Outreach funding can help rural communities obtain the start-up funding needed to test out and prove the merit of new approaches to addressing long-standing issues as well as emerging challenges in rural communities. As a recipient of a grant for the Outreach Program, grantees may be offered targeted technical assistance throughout the three years of the grant period to assist in achieving the project&amp;#191;s desired outcomes and ensure program sustainability after the grant is over. This additional support is provided at no extra cost to grantees as this is an investment made by ORHP to assist in the success of the grantee projects. ORHP has found that most grantees benefit greatly from the one-on-one support provided through this technical assistance. If an applicant is funded, the grantee will learn more about the targeted technical assistance (if offered).",

The program establishes an accelerated review/award process to support the crucial time frame in which these ancillary studies must be performed. Time-sensitive ancillary studies include those that require active longitudinal data collection and thus need to begin recruiting subjects as close as possible to the start of the parent study. The ancillary study can address any research questions related to the mission of NHLBI for which the parent study can provide participants, infrastructure, and data. The parent studies most often will be a clinical trial, but also can be an observational study or registry that can provide a sufficient cohort of well-characterized patients. Each ancillary study application must demonstrate the time-sensitive nature of the application and must explicitly address why an expedited review is essential to its feasibility.",

Primary outcomes of the research can include a patient self-report of medication adherence, but must also at least one non-self-report measure of medication adherence (e.g., pharmacy refill records, electronic monitoring, etc.). In addition, applications are encouraged to include a relevant health outcome or biomarker (e.g., blood pressure, viral load in HIV-infected individuals, cholesterol levels, HbA1c) that is expected to be affected by changes in the targeted adherence behavior.

Applications may target medication adherence in the context of treatment for a single illness or chronic condition (e.g., hypertension), to stave off a disease recurrence (e.g., cancer) or for multiple comorbid conditions (e.g., hypertension, diabetes, alcohol use disorders and HIV/AIDS). A well-articulated theoretical or conceptual framework is key for applications encouraged under this announcement. Applicants should demonstrate the feasibility of collecting multi-modal data on the targets of the intervention including: a patient self-report of medication adherence, at least one non-self-report measure of medication adherence (e.g., pharmacy refill records, electronic monitoring, etc.), and a relevant health outcome or biomarker (e.g., blood pressure, viral load in HIV-infected individuals, cholesterol levels, HbA1c) that is expected to be affected by changes in the targeted adherence behavior. For diseases without identified biomarkers, inclusion of a clinical assessment (e.g., a medicine blood level, diagnostic interview or an independent clinician rating of the symptoms and behaviors) may be considered. Applications for R21 awards should describe projects distinct from those supported through the traditional R01 mechanism. For example, long-term projects, or projects designed to increase knowledge in a well-established area, will not be considered for R21 awards. Applications submitted under this mechanism should be exploratory and novel. These studies should break new ground or extend previous discoveries toward new directions or applications.",

          "Description": "The Black Duck Joint Venture (BDJV) is a partnership-based conservation program under the North American Waterfowl Management Plan that promotes the conservation of Black Ducks by providing greater knowledge for effective management. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, a partner in the BDJV, administers grants and purchase orders on a competitive basis for projects/studies that advance both our and the general scientific community&amp;apos;s understanding of Black Duck ecology and is seeking proposals from interested parties. The BDJV will accept proposal addressing any aspect of black duck ecology and management, but proposals that address priority research needs (see full announcement) will have a greater probability of funding. Successful multi-year projects will be funded in 1-year increments, subject to annual review, demonstration of suitable progress, and funds availability. After 4 years of consecutive funding, those projects may reapply and compete for BDJV funds in one-year increments only and they will be re-evaluated based on their continued merit. To be competitive for funding, proposals should include both cash match and in-kind support. Currently the only source of general funding is U.S. Congress-appropriated funds directed to USFWS for BDJV use -- we are expected to demonstrate effective leveraging of these funds, preferably with non-U.S.-federal resources. Content and Form of Application: A complete application package will include the following components: 1.A project proposal 2.Standard Form (SF) 424",

These Research Programs are the fundamental part of the Pediatric Preclinical Testing Consortium (PPTC) initiative, which also includes a PPTC Coordinating Center (supported under RFA-CA-14-019). The main goal for PPTC is to develop a rigorous preclinical testing system for pediatric anticancer drug candidates and to generate reliable data that can be used to inform new agent prioritization decisions. This FOA invites applications for drug testing Research Programs focused on specific tumor types that are particularly relevant to pediatric oncology. Each application must propose only one testing Research Program from the following four types:Type A: Research Program for leukemia in vivo testing;Type B: Research Program for tumors of central nervous system (CNS) in vivo testing; Type C: Research Program for other (non-CNS) solid tumors testing in vivo; and Type D: Research Program for in vitro testing.Applicants may propose Research Programs of more than one type but only through separate applications for each. Applicants proposing in vivo testing programs must be capable of quantitative assessment of tumor regression and time to event for 6 to 10 new agents (or combinations of agents) annually across relevant, well-characterized preclinical models. All applicants are expected to have substantial expertise regarding the biology and therapeutic opportunities for the tumor types that they propose to study. The PPTC Research Program Awardees will be required to collaborate closely with the PPTC Coordinating Center.",

The PPTC will consist of in vivo and in vitro testing Research Programs (both supported under companion RFA-CA-14-018) and the PPTC Coordinating Center (supported under this FOA). The PPTC is designed to address key challenges associated with the development of new therapies for children with cancer by developing reliable preclinical testing data for pediatric drug candidates that can be used to inform new agent prioritization decisions. Effective prioritization is critical because of the large universe of drugs being developed for adult cancers, a number so large that no more than a small number can be studied in pediatric clinical trials. Identifying through preclinical testing those investigational agents most likely to have clinical activity for selected childhood cancers accelerates the pace at which treatments that are more effective than the current ones can be identified and incorporated into standard practice for children with cancer. The PPTC Research Programs, responsible for conducting the in vivo and in vitro testing of selected agents, will be focused on specific tumor types that are particularly relevant to pediatric oncology. The PPTC Coordinating Center, which is subject of this FOA, will be responsible for integrating the activities of the individual PPTC Research Programs to create a functional consortium for pediatric preclinical testing. Specifically, the PPTP-Coordinating Center will provide administrative coordination and infrastructure, data management and statistical support, as well as Consortium scientific coordination.",

To do this NCGMP provides funds for graduate and selected undergraduate students in academic research projects that involve geologic mapping as a major component. Through these cooperative agreements NCGMP hopes to expand the research and educational capacity of academic programs that teach earth science students the techniques of geologic mapping and field data analysis. Another important goal is to increase the level of communication between the Nations geologic surveys (both State Geological Surveys and the USGS) and geologic mappers in the academic community. We hope that this improved communication will have two results: 1) that the academic mapping community will learn more about the societal needs that drive geologic mapping projects at the USGS and State Geologic Surveys, and 2) more geologic maps produced in academia will eventually be made available to the public.",

The purpose of the National Maternal and Child Health Data Resource Center (DRC) Cooperative Agreement Program is to support a diverse population of stakeholders in the valid and standardized use of national, state, and community level data as it relates to the health of women, children and families. This cooperative agreement program will support the maintenance and expansion of a DRC that highlights, describes, and facilitates access to publicly available data with a focus on increasing access to and timely utilization of maternal and child health (MCH) data among state and local governments and non-governmental organizations, including HRSA grantees. Activities to increase both the availability of relevant data and the analytic capability of stakeholders will be done in a manner that aligns with and supports the Maternal and Child Health Bureau&amp;#191;s (MCHB) initiative to evaluate the effectiveness of MCH programming through the use of national and state-selected performance measures. For the 2015-2018 funding cycle, the objectives of this project are: 1) Continue a strategic expansion of the MCH-relevant datasets available on the DRC&amp;#191;s website to support the changing analytic needs of MCH stakeholders. Specifically, this expansion will include state-level estimates for a selection of the newly specified national outcome and performance measures under the Title V MCH Services Block Grant. 2) Increase the number and diversity of stakeholders who utilize this resource while ensuring that the resource remains both scientifically-sound and user-friendly. 3) Support state and local MCH programs in the utilization of valid and standardized data to monitor and evaluate program effectiveness, including state-initiated tracking of &amp;#191;real time&amp;#191; data for high priority MCH indicators where feasible.",

          "Description": "The Environmental Studies Program (ESP) of the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (BOEM) is offering two cooperative agreement opportunities to conduct research in topics that serve the public interest of safe and environmentally sound energy and mineral production on the nation&amp;apos;s outer continental shelf. The BOEM manages the exploration and development of the nation&amp;apos;s offshore resources. The bureau seeks to balance economic development, energy independence, and environmental protection through oil and gas leases, renewable energy development and environmental reviews and studies. Section 1346 of the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (OCSLA) mandates the conduct of environmental and socioeconomic studies needed for the assessment and management of environmental impacts on the human, marine, and coastal environments which may be affected by energy development. OCSLA Section 1345 authorizes the use of cooperative agreements with affected States to meet the requirements of OCSLA, including sharing of information, joint utilization of available expertise, formation of joint monitoring arrangements to carry out applicable Federal and State laws, regulations, and stipulations relevant to outer continental shelf operations both onshore and offshore. The total amount of funding available in Fiscal Year 2012 under this amendment to this NOFA is an amount not to exceed $800,000. The BOEM anticipates making two cooperative agreement awards for proposals to be submitted by the Commonwealths of Virginia and Massachusetts under this program announcement. Work performance under this award must start before September 30, 2012.",

This announcement is to provide public notice of the National Park Service&amp;#191;s intention to fund the following project activities without full and open competition. ABSTRACT Funding Announcement P14AS00354 Project Title Web Mapping and EGIS Support Recipient Colorado State University Principle Investigator / Program Manager Melanie Laituri Total Anticipated Award Amount $663,459.20 Cost Share none New Award or Continuation? Continuation of Cooperative Agreement P14AC00728 Anticipated Length of Agreement From date of award until September 29, 2015 Anticipated Period of Performance From date of award until September 29, 2015 Award Instrument Cooperative Agreement Statutory Authority 16 USC 1(g) 16 USC 5933, 16 USC 1a-2(j) CFDA # and Title 15.945 Cooperative Research &amp;amp; Training Programs &amp;#191; Resources of NPS CESU&amp;#191;s Single Source Justification Criteria Cited (2) Continuation NPS Point of Contact June Zastrow 303-987-6718 june_zastrow@nps.gov OVERVIEW Cooperative Agreement Number P14AC00728 was entered into by and between the Department of the Interior, National Park Service (NPS), and the Colorado State University (CSU) to provide research, technical assistance and education to federal land management, environmental and research agencies and their potential partners; that involves the biological, physical, social, and cultural sciences needed to address resources issues and interdisciplinary problem-solving at multiple scales and in an ecosystem context at the local, regional, and national level; and place special emphasis on the working collaboration among federal agencies and universities and their related partner institutions. Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms and conditions as stated in the Cooperative Agreement will apply to this Task Agreement. The primary objective is to leverage both public and internal interest and support for the upcoming centennial to modernize the NPS&amp;#191;s digital outreach strategy. Maps are a key component of this modernization effort. To support this modernization, the NPS&amp;#191; mapping platforms and efforts need to be updated so the agency&amp;#191;s mapping products can be disseminated more widely and used more effectively on all platforms - including the NPS.gov website and mobile devices such as smart phones and tablets. This work will require nearly constant research and development to keep up with the ever-changing technological landscape. To meet this objective, the NPS must maintain consistent engagement with the public and other federal, state, and local agencies. Related to mapping, this increased engagement will include accepting &amp;#191;crowd-sourced&amp;#191; data from members of the public and integrating it into park maps. It will also include working hand-in-hand with other government agencies and non-profit organizations to improve collaboration and communication. In fact, most of the products built and maintained under this task agreement will be released under an open source license so other organizations can take advantage of the work. In this way, the NPS and CSU will continue to lead the way in web mapping through openness and transparency. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT &amp;#9679; Provide research associates under the supervision of the Principal Investigator. &amp;#9679; CSU researchers will participate in cooperative teams with the NPS that may be led by either party. Close working relationships with outside partners and affiliates and substantial involvement of multiple programs will be required to successfully complete this task. &amp;#9679; Work collaboratively with NPS staff, affiliates, academia, and the public (as appropriate) to complete research reports and recommendations, user and stakeholder requirements, and engagement, project plans, computer code, mapping products, and user and technical documentation. &amp;#9679; Ensure products comply with Section 508 (36 CFR Part 1194 Subpart C Section 31 and 41) to the fullest extent possible. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: &amp;#9679; RISD staff members and affiliates will collaborate on this project with the CSU research associates under the supervision of the Principal Investigator. &amp;#9679; Provide office space and other necessary material support (equipment and travel) to allow the researchers to perform their work and publish the products to university affiliates, partners, and the public. &amp;#9679; NPS staff and CSU researchers will participate in cooperative teams. Close working relationships with outside partners and affiliates and substantial involvement of multiple programs will be required for success. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award. The justification must address one or more of the following criteria as well as discussion of the program legislative history, unique capabilities of the proposed recipient, and cost-sharing contribution offered by the proposed recipient, as applicable. In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria: (1) Unsolicited Proposal &amp;#191; The proposed award is the result of an unsolicited assistance application which represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach which is not the subject of a current or planned contract or assistance award, but which is deemed advantageous to the program objectives; (2) Continuation &amp;#191; The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation of an activity presently being funded, and for which competition would have a significant adverse effect on the continuity or completion of the activity; (3) Legislative intent &amp;#191; The language in the applicable authorizing legislation or legislative history clearly indicates Congress&amp;#191; intent to restrict the award to a particular recipient of purpose; (4) Unique Qualifications &amp;#191; The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon a variety of demonstrable factors such as location, property ownership, voluntary support capacity, cost-sharing ability if applicable, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications; (5) Emergencies &amp;#191; Program/award where there is insufficient time available (due to a compelling and unusual urgency, or substantial danger to health or safety) for adequate competitive procedures to be followed. The National Park Service did not solicit full and open competition for this award based the following criteria: (2) CONTINUATION SINGLE SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DESCRIPTION: THIS IS A NOTICE OF INTENT TO AWARD This is a Task Agreement (P14AC01681) under Cooperative Agreement (P14AC00728) in the amount of $633,459.20 with a period of performance from date of award until 09/29/2015. &amp;quot;This proposed project between Colorado State University and the NPS is authorized to go through the Rocky Mountains CESU at the negotiated overhead rate of 17.5% because it passes the test of substantial involvement by the NPS, public purpose and consistency with the mission of the CESU Network&amp;quot;.

          "Description": "The Bar 4 well was completed in 1996. The well was drilled to a depth of 3,110 feet. A pumpjack was installed at that time for well testing. The well was equipped later that year with a permanent pumpjack (photo above). The pumpjack was removed in 1999 for temporary installation of an electric submersible pump and pressure transducer to test the well at a higher rate than possible with the installed pump. The original pumpjack was reinstalled afterward. In the spring of 2001, the USBR replaced the pump barrel which was found to be no longer functional due to corrosion and deterioration. It appears the last time the pump has been operated since then was in May 2002 for collection of a water sample. Several other water samples have also been collected since the well was installed. NRCE inspected the well in 2007 and in 2013. The pumpjack appears to be serviceable and in good condition. The condition of the pump barrel is unknown, and due to infrequent operation, may have suffered corrosion and deterioration since its last operation. It is therefore necessary to operate the pump in order to identify any problems that need to be repaired prior to placing the system in full-time operation. There is currently no source of power at the site to run the pump motor. The Havasupai Tribe propose to conduct a service and test run of the Bar 4 well before moving forward with the proposed development of the Bar 4 residential community and to enable routine sampling of the well. The approach for rehabilitation of this well is broken into five tasks. The outcome of each task dictates the necessity of and requirements for subsequent tasks. The tasks are: Task 1 Startup test and operation of well Task 2 Pumpjack service (surface equipment) Task 3 Power Supply Task 4 Water analysis Task 5 Report",

The program will also continue moderate expansion of access to HIV/AIDS services while building the capacity of national structures and contributing to sustainable service delivery within the health sector in C&amp;#244;te d&amp;#146;Ivoire, with a primary focus of activities in northern regions. Specifically, it serves to increase capacity and sustainability of the response to the HIV/AIDS crisis by initially providing support for HIV service delivery and ultimately providing technical assistance to indigenous Ivorian organizations and the national Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Fight Against AIDS (MSLS) to sustain and expand comprehensive HIV prevention, care, and ART programs. Successful grantees will combine a facility-based strategy with complementary community mobilization and follow up for case management to support retention in quality HIV/AIDS services. At the end of the 5 year project period, the recipient should be able to collect and evaluate program data that demonstrate improved quality of HIV prevention, care and treatment services in northern C&amp;#244;te d&amp;#146;Ivoire and to transition activities to MSLS and/or local organizations to sustain a basic HIV service package.",

          "Description": "The development, implementation, and support of quality management systems across clinical, laboratory and healthcare management services is a core element of PEPFAR&amp;#146;s long-term quality strategy for supported countries. The accreditation of laboratories is a &amp;#147;foundational&amp;#148; component of this strategy, which applies to facilities engaged in HIV diagnostics, as well as blood service labs engaged in HIV and other infectious disease screening, and the preparation of blood components for transfusion. Information systems that facilitate the rapid capture, management and analysis of information generated by a laboratory&amp;#146;s or blood service&amp;#146;s routine operations are an essential tool for laboratories seeking accreditation. However, the costs associated with procuring, installing and maintaining electronic information systems have historically been barrier to access for laboratories and blood services in sub-Saharan Africa (and other developing regions). As a result, many blood services and laboratory systems in Africa and other resource-limited settings rely on sub-optimal paper-based systems, or limited electronic systems that are unable to capture and trace information (forward and backwards) through every link in the blood service or laboratory value chain. For blood services this means the ability to trace a unit of blood and related information from the blood donor to the transfusion recipient; for a laboratory this means the ability to trace specimens and related information from the collection point back to the physician providing care to the patient who provided the specimen.To address this gap, PEPFAR is supporting the development and implementation of lower-cost, quality assured information systems based on open source technologies. To promote the sustainability of this initiative, PEPFAR and CDC seek to fund an organization with experience in open source software development and implementation to provide such support to PEPFAR supported countries.",

Eligible Applicants:   Government Organizations:  &amp;#149; State or their bona fide agents (includes the District of Columbia)  &amp;#149; Local governments or their bona fide agents  &amp;#149; Territorial governments or their bona fide agents in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Marianna Islands, American Samoa, Guam, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and the Republic of Palau)   2. Special Eligibility Requirements: N/A  3. Justification for Less than Maximum Competition:   The Medical Monitoring Project or MMP is a national public health surveillance program designed to collect clinical and behavioral information on those diagnosed with HIV or AIDS. Competition for MMP funds is limited to the twenty-six (26) established MMP sites originally selected in 2004.  These particular sites were selected to represent the HIV epidemic in the United States.  Process for the selection and establishment of MMP sites has been published in a scientific journal; a detailed description of the process used for selection is available at: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3462615/pdf/TOAIDJ-6-67.pdf.   The established MMP sites have enabled CDC to obtain data that represent the country as a whole starting in 2004.  Ascertainment of representative national data is the goal of MMP.        Twenty States or territories, including six jurisdictions which are separately funded for other HIV/AIDS program activities within states, were selected to participate in MMP in 2004.  These 26 sites have built the capacity to successfully perform MMP and enable CDC to meet surveillance goals by producing national estimates characterizing the US epidemic. The selected sites were: California Department of Health Services; Chicago Department of Public Health; Delaware Department of Health and Social Services; Florida Department of Health; Georgia Department of Public Health; Houston Department of Health and Human Services; Illinois Department of Public Health; Indiana State Department of Health; Los Angeles County Health Department; Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; Massachusetts Department of Public Health; Michigan Department of Community Health; Mississippi Department of Health; New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services; New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene; New York State Department of Health; North Carolina Department of Health and Human Services; Oregon Department of Human Services; Pennsylvania Department of Health; Philadelphia Department of Public Health; Puerto Rico Health Department; San Francisco Department of Public Health; South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control; Texas Department of State Health Services; Virginia Department of Health; and Washington State Department of Health. These are the twenty-six areas eligible to apply and continue to conduct MMP activities.      In order to appropriately use MMP data for prevention and to evaluate national HIV-related health care initiatives including portions of the Affordable Care Act, the data collected in MMP must be nationally representative. If competition is not limited to the 26 established sites listed above, MMP would not be adhering to the scientific sampling strategy chosen for its project design.  Without this adherence, MMP data would not be nationally representative and would no longer produce reports that represent the HIV epidemic in the United States.",

          "Description": "The U.S. Department of the Interior&amp;#146;s WaterSMART (Sustain and Manage America&amp;#146;s Resources for Tomorrow) program establishes a framework to provide Federal leadership and assistance on the efficient use of water, integrating water and energy policies to support the sustainable use of all natural resources, and coordinating the water conservation activities of various DOI bureaus and offices. Through the program, DOI is working to achieve a sustainable water strategy to meet the Nation&amp;#146;s water needs. The Bureau of Reclamation&amp;#146;s Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse program (Title XVI) is an important part of WaterSMART. For purposes of the Title XVI program, a water reuse project is a project that reclaims and reuses municipal, industrial, domestic, or agricultural wastewater and naturally impaired groundwater and/or surface waters. Reclaimed water can be used for a variety of purposes, such as environmental restoration, fish and wildlife, groundwater recharge, municipal, domestic, industrial, agricultural, power generation, or recreation. Water reuse is an essential tool in stretching the limited water supplies in the Western United States. Title XVI projects develop and supplement urban and irrigation water supplies through water reuse, thereby improving efficiency, providing flexibility during water shortages, and diversifying the water supply. Title XVI projects provide growing communities with new sources of clean water while promoting water and energy efficiency and environmental stewardship. The objective of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to invite applicants to submit proposals for the development of new Title XVI feasibility studies. Applicants must provide 50 percent non-Federal cost share for the proposed activity. Proposed activities should begin in FY 2012 and be completed by March 31, 2014. Under Title XVI of P.L. 102-575, Reclamation works to identify and investigate opportunities to reclaim and reuse wastewaters and naturally impaired ground and surface water in the 17 Western States and Hawaii. Title XVI also provides authority for Reclamation to provide up to 50 percent of the costs of studies to determine the feasibility of water reclamation and reuse projects. Prior to construction funding of any project authorized under Title XVI, Reclamation must determine that a feasibility study for the project complies with the provisions of Title XVI. Under this FOA, funding is being made available to assist project sponsors with the development of new Title XVI feasibility studies. For further information on the requirements of a Title XVI feasibility study, see Reclamation Manual Directive &amp;amp; Standard Title XVI Water Reclamation and Reuse Program Feasibility Study Review Process (WTR 11-01), .",

CFDA 15.931, Conservation Activities by Youth Service Organizations. Single Source Justification Criteria Sited: JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SINGLE SOURCE) FOR DISCRETIONARY COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS BACKGROUND: This project is the third phase of multi-year project for the repair and construction of a 10 unit campground. Specifically the project is to perform new trails construction with in the campground to provide better access to facilities and prevent further resource damage. Under this Agreement, the youth crews will travel to the parks and provide assistance with Fire ring, picnic table and Sign installation in conjunction with construction of three small trails. In addition to control work, youth crews may assist in slope stabilization and re- vegetation of disturbed areas. 1) 505 DM 2 Single Source - Only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements. The source identified for this agreement is the Southeast Alaska Guidance Association (SAGA). SAGA has been a partner with the NPS &amp;#150; Alaska Region for several years and has a proven, positive track record. SAGA crews provide a compliment to the Alaska trail&amp;#146;s management efforts. These crews have participated in extensive manual Trails management in isolated areas of the region&amp;#146;s park. They have shown great flexibility in working with different parks to organize the numerous specialized logistics, such as transportation, and equipment, associated with these remote areas. Being a local, Alaska-based organization &amp;#150; they bring specific knowledge of the varied landscapes, potential hazards, safety concerns, and project logistics to the table. In addition, SAGA&amp;#146;s ability to provide a single crew for the entirety of the work season would save the National Park Service time and money. 2) Nature and description of the deliverable required to meet the agency&amp;#146;s needs: The purpose of this partnership is to specify a partnership project between the NPS and SAGA which involves Trails construction and campsite development in Wrangell St. Elias National Park and Preserve more specifically work will be completed in Twin Lakes campground. Work will start on the first week of July and run five consecutive weeks. Under this Agreement, the youth crews will travel to the parks and provide assistance with Fire ring, picnic table and Sign installation in conjunction with construction of three small trails. In addition to control work, youth crews may assist in slope stabilization and re- vegetation of disturbed areas. The Southeast Alaska Guidance Association agrees to: &amp;#149; Provide a trained five to six-member crew, with two leaders experienced in supervision and ensuring basic work safety. &amp;#149; Assure that crew will be physically able to do manual labor for an eight-hour day norm. &amp;#149; Provide transportation to the work site, camp gear and food for all crew members and daily maintenance and cleaning to camp facilities. &amp;#149; Complete trails construction and campground modifications for Wrangell-St. Elias NPP. &amp;#149; Coordinate work schedule with NPS Project Inspector to ensure project completion within target schedule, based on the tentative work schedule listed above. 3) Criteria for justifying award without competition.

          "Description": "This announcement solicits new and competing continuation applications for fiscal year (FY) 2015 Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part C Early Intervention Services (EIS). Funds will support outpatient HIV primary care services targeted to low-income, vulnerable, medically underserved people living with HIV/AIDS including women, infants, children and youth. The purpose of the RWHAP Part C EIS Program is to provide HIV primary care in the outpatient setting. Applicants must propose to provide a comprehensive continuum of outpatient HIV primary care services in the designated service area including: 1) targeted HIV counseling, testing, and referral; 2) medical evaluation and clinical care; 3) other primary care services; and 4) referrals to other health services. Primary care for persons with HIV disease should start as early in the course of the infection as possible. However, entry into a RWHAP Part C EIS program may take place at any point in the spectrum of the disease or the patient&amp;#191;s lifespan. This competition is open to existing and new organizations proposing to provide RWHAP Part C funded services in the service areas described in Appendix B. Applicants must define their proposed service area, which may be a portion of or the entire published service area. Applicants proposing to serve less than all of the service area as listed in Appendix B must demonstrate the availability of comprehensive care and services to the entire service area through partners or other RWHAP providers. Applicants that have overlapping geographic service areas must propose to provide additional services, or target specific vulnerable populations, and/or provide services that enhance the existing services in the area. New organizations must demonstrate that they will serve the existing patients and populations, and provide at least the same scope of services of the current grantee. New applicants must identify the grantee (listed in Appendix B) they intend to replace. As established in section 2651 of the PHS Act, and according to the terms and conditions of these awards, a RWHAP Part C program grantee must expend grant funds to provide HIV primary medical care in a proposed service area. These services must be reflected in the budget. Staff positions such as nurses, medical assistants and dental hygienists can be included in the budget when the position proportionately complements HIV primary medical care providers, such as physicians, dentists, physician assistants, or nurse practitioners for the RWHAP Part C program. Accordingly, a RWHAP Part C budget must reflect a medical model of care in which providers can assess, treat and refer, as applicable. Providers must be authorized, via credentialing and licensure, to prescribe medications, order medically indicated tests/exams, interpret symptoms, treat, and meet Department of Health and Human Services&amp;#191; (HHS) guidelines. Applicants are expected to focus RWHAP Part C supported services on those populations of persons living with HIV (PLWH) who are the hardest to reach, have the greatest unmet need, and/or the greatest gaps in HIV primary care services as documented by local epidemiologic and needs assessment data. These populations include (but are not limited to) minorities, youth, women, pregnant women, post-incarcerated persons, and homeless persons. Applicants will be expected to have the financial capabilities to execute the fiduciary responsibilities that come with acceptance of a federal award. Applicants must demonstrate that they are fiscally able to perform the duties and services outlined in this grant. RWHAP Part C programs should comply with federally-approved guidelines for HIV Prevention and Treatment (see http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov/ as a reliable source for current guidelines). More information can also be found at: http://www.whitehouse.gov/administration/eop/onap/ . The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), and HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) are committed to meeting the national goals and principles described below. As applicants complete their RWHAP Part C proposal, they should consider how their program supports and helps to implement these goals and principles.",

The program engages teams of participants including university students, military veterans, and high school graduates working during the year in three 10 to 12 week sessions. The participants will be led by an experienced CPI team leader who will report directly to the CPI Job Site Supervisor who will be onsite at all times. All work will be coordinated and guided by GGNRA. The collaboratively-developed work plan will focus on the preservation of small to medium scale concrete features. The experience will expose students to the NPS by merging knowledge of historic preservation and the Secretary of Interior Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with the concrete industry. A goal of this collaboration is to encourage youth to become future NPS professionals. This cooperative partnership will focus on the stewardship of park cultural resources which will have a mutually beneficial impact on the visitor experience. The project scope includes &amp;#191;Mentoring Days&amp;#191; in which CPI students serve as mentors for high school volunteer groups working on other projects within GGNRA thus encouraging the next generation to attend college and consider similar fields of study. Phase 1 (starting in the summer of 2014) is being funded as part of this initial Task Agreement (TA), and will focus on repairs to the west wall of the Powerhouse; the concrete railings behind Building 64; and, the concrete posts and handrails on the stairs leading to the Recreation Yard on Alcatraz. Future phases will be added through modifications to this TA and are dependent upon need, successful completion of previous phases, and availability of funding.",

This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) will consider applications for the development of novel imaging instrumentation and measurement technologies that support the integrative analysis of communication among subcellular compartments, between individual microbial cells and within multicellular communities/plant tissues. The goal is to develop in situ, dynamic and nondestructive approaches to enable multifunctional imaging, quantitative flux measurements, and multiscale integrative analysis of bioenergy-relevant plant and microbial systems. Ideally, these imaging approaches will pave the way for predictive understanding of the spatial and temporal relationships, physical connections, and chemical exchanges that facilitate the flow of materials and information across membranes and between intracellular sp aces. The anticipated outcome of this FOA is the development of in situ imaging and measurement technologies that can (1) resolve multiple key metabolic processes over time within or among cells and (2) bridge the critical gap in linking molecular-scale information to whole-cell, systems-level understanding.",

This announcement solicits proposals for reducing the loss to follow-up of infants who have not passed a physiologic newborn hearing screening examination prior to discharge from the newborn nursery by utilizing specifically targeted and measurable interventions. The purpose of this funding opportunity is to further focus efforts to improve the loss to follow-up/loss to documentation (LTF/D) by utilizing specific interventions such as quality improvement methodology to achieve measurable improvement in the numbers of infants who receive appropriate and timely follow-up. The (LTF/D) percentage dropped by 10% between 2009 and 2012, the last year for which we have annual data. The goal is that there will be at least a 5% per year reduction in the LTF/D in years 2015 through 2016. To accomplish the stated purpose of this funding opportunity, states are expected to use quality improvement methodology that will include gathering a team of stakeholders or reinvigorating an existing team to assist in the quality improvement work. Teams should include, at a minimum, the state EHDI (Early Hearing Detection and Intervention) coordinator as the lead person, a pediatric audiologist, a parent of a child with a hearing loss, a representative from the early intervention program, and a data person. A meeting schedule should be set up for the teams. The team will need to craft an aim statement, identify change strategies, implement Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to decide what changes lead to improvement, and spread successful changes throughout the system. Data should be collected and provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)in a timely manner, and reviewed and analyzed on an ongoing basis to determine if the changes proposed in the work scope of the application have led to system-wide improvements and reported out to the appropriate stakeholders.",

          "Description": "This announcement solicits applications for a National Technical Resource Center for Newborn Hearing Screening and Intervention (Center) in support of the Universal Newborn Hearing Screening Program (UNHS). The purpose of the UNHS program is to utilize specifically targeted and measurable interventions to increase the number of infants who are followed up for rescreening, referral, and intervention after having not passed a physiologic newborn screening examination prior to discharge from the newborn nursery. The focus of the Center will be to provide to state Early Hearing Detection and Intervention (EHDI) programs training and technical assistance for planning, policy development, implementing innovations and quality improvement methodology to reduce their loss to follow-up rate/loss to documentation (LTF/D), i.e. the number of infants who do not receive timely and appropriate screening follow-up and coordinated interventions. The goals of the Center are to: (1) improve the performance of state EHDI programs in decreasing the loss to follow-up rates by 5% per year, especially in rural and underserved communities; and (2) increase to 100% the number of state EHDI programs that have incorporated quality improvement methodology and processes into their operations. The goals will be addressed through the following strategies: &amp;#183; Forming a multidisciplinary project advisory group to include family representatives, members of medically underserved populations, pediatric health professionals, audiologists, public health representatives, evaluators, quality improvement and telehealth experts; &amp;#183; Identifying and exploring innovative and promising practices. Examples include the linkage of newborns to family-centered medical homes (FCMH), the coordination between FCMH and early intervention programs, the linkage to home visiting programs, and the use of telehealth/teleinteventions for improving access to screening follow-up services, including diagnosis and interventions; &amp;#183; Developing and implementing a dissemination and diffusion of nnovations plan that includes the following: the target population, goals, improvements, culturally and linguistically competent tools, measures, methods and channels to be used for communication with opinion leaders, peers, stakeholders, and other key audiences; &amp;#183; Providing technical assistance to state EHDI programs both individually and through learning communities, regarding workforce solutions, policy and finance approaches for sustaining their programs, and integration of their efforts with other state early childhood and health promotion (i.e., medical home approach) efforts; and &amp;#183; Working cooperatively and collaboratively with Federal and non-Federal programs function, including American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the National Center for Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Head Start Bureau at the Administration for Children and Families, National Institute of Health, the Department of Education&amp;#191;s IDEA Part C Early Intervention programs, and other pertinent organizations related to the implementation of sustainable EHDI programs. Anticipated targets for the Center include the following: &amp;#183; 100% of the state EHDI programs will have incorporated quality improvement methodology processes into their operations; &amp;#183; At least 25 states will have conducted a feasibility study of electronic linkages between EHDI databases and vital statistics, early intervention, and/or immunization databases to enable easy retrieval of newborn hearing screening results by health care practitioners; &amp;#183; Double the number of states from four to eight (4 to 8) that employ telehealth technology to increase access to services for infants in the UNHS program; and &amp;#183; 95% of states will have a process in place to facilitate the linkage of all infants in the UNHS program to FCMH. Success of the program will be reflected in annual data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicating that: &amp;#183; Each state/territory has met the annual performance requirement of reducing the LTF/D percentage by 5%; &amp;#183; Maintain the percentage of infants who are screened before one (1) month of age at 98%; &amp;#183; Increase the percentage of infants who fail their newborn hearing screening that will have an audiologic diagnosis before three (3) months of age to 90% from 70% in 2012 and; &amp;#183; 95% of infants found to have a hearing loss will be enrolled in an early intervention program before six (6) months of age.",

          "Description": "This Request for Applications (RFA) for Haiti, specifically, provides information on funding opportunities for multi-year, development food aid programs. Food security is the cornerstone of the Title II program because &amp;#147;&amp;#133;enhancing food security in the developing world through the use of agricultural commodities&amp;#133;&amp;#148; is a policy of the United States as stated in the Food for Peace Act, which authorizes Title II food aid. Thus, FFP&amp;#146;s goal for multi-year development programming is to reduce risks and vulnerabilities to food insecurity and increase food availability, access and utilization/consumption. Title II programs must target the vulnerability of food insecure individuals, households and communities directly. Note that assistance made available pursuant to this RFA may be used to meet emergency/exceptional circumstances as provided in accordance with the terms of those awards and 22 C.F. R. 211.5(o). In this past this had been capped at 10 percent, however, based on the use of trigger indicators, this level may be exceeded. FFP would greatly appreciate receiving consolidated comments on this draft RFA for Haiti from the representative groups of the FACG.

          "Description": "The U.S. Consulate General Kolkata will host the fourth &amp;#147;Trafficking in Persons Conclave&amp;#148; in Ranchi, Jharkhand, to reinforce its commitment to combat human trafficking. The first two conclaves were held in Kolkata in 2012, followed by the third international conclave in Guwahati in 2013, have helped secure Kolkata Consulate&amp;#146;s position as a key partner in strengthening the anti-trafficking movement at the regional level as part of our common efforts to eliminate trafficking in persons globally. Having worked in close association with the government, police, business, civil society and the NGO sectors in West Bengal and the North Eastern states, Consulate Kolkata would now like to strengthen partnerships in the Bihar- Jharkhand belt. Trafficking in Jharkhand has increased threefold in the past three years, according to data released by the Indian Social Welfare, Women and Children Development Department that works on behalf of rescued persons. In recent years, the state of Jharkhand has emerged as a vulnerable state for trafficking of women and children for forced labor and slavery. Thousands of children from Jharkhand are traded and trafficked by placement agencies to domestic homes in Delhi and other Indian cities. Abject poverty, illiteracy, ignorance, difficult access areas, shrinking land holding by the local populace, network of placement agencies and, most importantly, the vulnerability of the tribal population has been cited as the main reasons for large-scale safe and unsafe migration from Jharkhand to other cities. The proposed two-day Conclave will address the lack of coordinated efforts in addressing this problem by bringing together key stakeholders from NGOs, government, business houses, law enforcement agencies, civil society organizations and the legal fraternity to encourage increased networking and cooperation to tackle this growing menace. The U.S. Consulate Kolkata seeks applications from a &amp;#147;valid&amp;#148; U.S. or Indian organization to organize and execute this conclave (refer to Section IV). In case the applicant is an organization from the U.S, they will have to choose and work in close partnership with a local partner/sub-awardee. The awardee will work together with key stakeholders at the regional, national and international level to develop an agenda, invite local and international speakers and manage all logistics for the conference. One significant purpose of this cooperative agreement is to strengthen networking among the anti-TIP partners between Bihar/Jharkhand (which is the source) and North and West India (which are the destinations).The Conclave will also continue to strengthen networking with the border countries of India, including Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Burma.Proposals should be based on the framework of a two-day conference to include a networking reception and not more than ten panels/ discussions featuring a maximum of 50 speakers/presenters. The U.S. Consulate General Kolkata will also work separately to secure funding for a U.S. anti -TIP expert whose participation will bring in a global perspective. The awardee will invite appropriate local participants from cities including but not limited to Ranchi, Jharkhand, Patna, Bihar, Kolkata and Delhi, representatives from Northeast states, and appropriate representation from Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan and Burma- approximately 100 people, including but not limited to, government officials, police, judiciary, prosecutors and the legal fraternity, business people, and local and international NGOs. The awardee must receive approval from the U.S. Consulate General Kolkata on the final list of invited participants and the media strategy to amplify the impact of this conclave. Topics for the conference should include, but are not limited to, domestic and bonded labor trafficking, child protection issues, timely coordination between anti human trafficking units, NGOs, law enforcement agencies and the judiciary, and the role of CSR in addressing exploitative child labor issues and developing marketable skills for the vulnerable community.

          "Description": "CDC, in collaboration with the National AIDS Control Program/Department of AIDS Control, has successfully laid the foundation for quality standards and approaches within India&amp;#146;s vast HIV laboratory network through a previous five-year laboratory strengthening funding opportunity announcement (FOA). Many achievements were made during the course of the five-year project period, including accreditation of national and state reference labs. This follow-on FOA is expected to build upon and sustain previous accomplishments through onsite mentoring and in service staff training with an eye to higher quality services and scale up. A plan will be developed to facilitate laboratory quality at the grassroots level for 12,000 + Integrated HIV Testing and Counseling Centers (ICTCs). This shall be done through trainer/mentor creation within the HIV laboratory network to assist peripheral laboratories in implementing minimum quality standards. Given its expanded technical assistance (TA) scope, it is also expected to build the capacity and assure quality in a phased manner for HIV related tests like CD4 enumeration, HIV viral load and STI through strengthening leadership and mentoring capacity within the laboratory network. Now in Phase IV of its HIV/AIDS response, the Government of India (GoI) is keen to address any gaps in testing coverage.",

          "Description": "Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) have awarded a large share of bachelor&amp;apos;s degrees to African American students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM), and the top ten baccalaureate institutions of African American STEM doctorate recipients from 2002-2006 are HBCUs. [1] To meet the nation&amp;apos;s accelerating demands for STEM talent, more rapid gains in achievement, success and degree production in STEM for underrepresented minority populations are needed. The Historically Black Colleges and Universities Undergraduate Program (HBCU-UP) is committed to enhancing the quality of undergraduate STEM education and research at HBCUs as a means to broaden participation in the nation&amp;apos;s STEM workforce. To this end, HBCU-UP provides awards to develop, implement, and study innovative models and approaches for making dramatic improvements in the preparation and success of HBCU undergraduate students so that they may participate successfully in STEM graduate programs and/or careers in STEM disciplines. Support is available for Targeted Infusion Projects, Broadening Participation Research Projects, Research Initiation Awards, Implementation Projects and Achieving Competitive Excellence Implementation Projects, as well as other funding opportunities.Targeted Infusion Projects (TIP) provide support to achieve a short-term, well-defined goal to innovate or improve the quality of undergraduate STEM education at HBCUs. Targeted Infusion Projects could create or adapt innovative learning experiences and pedagogies in STEM fields. Projects could develop creative uses of cyberlearning, specifically learning with cyberinfrastructure tools. Projects could enhance academic infrastructure by updating curriculum, modernizing laboratory research equipment, or improving the computational network array for research and education. Projects could enhance existing degree programs, establish new degree programs or concentrations, secure specialized accreditation or certification, or infuse STEM programs with disciplinary field advances and evolving workforce requirements. Projects that develop faculty expertise, promote implementation of educational innovations, or link to the preparation of future K-12 teachers are encouraged. Projects should be guided by research on teaching and learning.The Broadening Participation Research (BPR) in STEM Education track provides support to research projects that seek to create and study new theory-driven models and innovations related to the participation and success of diverse groups in STEM undergraduate education. BPR projects add new research-based strategies and models to broadening participation in STEM and increase the capacity of scholars at Historically Black Universities and Colleges to conduct this type of research. Research Initiation Awards (RIA) provide support for a STEM faculty member at the HBCU to pursue research at the home institution, at an NSF-funded research Center, at a research intensive institution, or at a national laboratory. Awards are intended to help further the faculty member&amp;apos;s research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and education at his or her home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. Research Initiation Awards are for junior faculty who are starting to build a research program, as well as for mid-career faculty who may have returned to the faculty ranks after holding an administrative post or who for some other reason need to redirect and rebuild a research program. Faculty members who hold an active Federal research award are not eligible for the Research Initiation Award.Implementation Projects provide support to design, implement, study, and assess comprehensive institutional efforts to increase the numbers of students and the quality of their preparation by strengthening STEM education and research. Implementation projects create and/or adapt and assess innovative models and materials for teaching and learning in STEM, embody knowledge about how students learn most effectively in STEM teaching and learning activities, and bring STEM disciplinary advances into the undergraduate experience. Within this track, Achieving Competitive Excellence (ACE) Implementation Projects are intended for HBCUs with exemplary achievements and established institutionalized foundations from previous Implementation Project grants. ACE seeks ambitious, potentially transformative proposals that have the promise of significant advances in STEM undergraduate education at the institution. Other funding opportunities include: Conferences, Symposia, and Workshops; EArly-concept Grants for Exploratory Research (EAGER) and Grants for Rapid Response Research (RAPID); as well as Grant Supplements for existing awards. Additionally, PIs are invited to seek supplemental support from NSF for their participating students and faculty who are accepted as participants in one of four Department of Energy initiatives: Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internships (SULI), Faculty-Student Teams (FaST), Community College Institutes (CCI),and Pre-Service Teacher (PST) Internships. These initiatives are intended to support the research opportunities in DoE national laboratories during the summer. Planning Grants for institutional STEM self-analysis and action planning which lead to an HBCU-UP proposal submission may be submitted as unsolicited proposals. Division of Human Resource Development (HRD) Special Call for ProposalsBPS-Resource Network: This solicitation includes a special call for design proposals that will lead to the development of a Broadening Participation in STEM Resource Network (BPS-Resource Network). The purpose of the BPS-Resource Network will be to assist all HRD grantees as well as other NSF stakeholders in achieving the performance goal in the NSF Strategic Plan for 2011-2016 to &amp;quot;Prepare and engage a diverse STEM workforce motivated to participate at the frontiers.&amp;quot; Design project proposals are encouraged from all eligible NSF proposers. The scope of the BPS-Resource Network design proposals should not be limited to the HBCU-UP program goal.

          "Description": "The Math and Science Partnership (MSP) program is a major research and development effort that supports innovative partnerships to improve K-12 student achievement in mathematics and science. MSP projects are expected to raise the achievement levels of all students and significantly reduce achievement gaps in the STEM performance of diverse student populations. MSP projects contribute to what is known in K-12 STEM education. All STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) fields supported by NSF may be involved in this work, with special encouragement to areas that are gaining increased traction at the K-12 level, such as computer science and engineering, in addition to mathematics and science. MSP projects also serve as models that have a sufficiently strong evidence/research base to improve STEM education outcomes for all students. Through this solicitation, NSF seeks to support two levels of Targeted Partnership awards, Implementation and Prototype. Implementation awards are intended to develop and put into practice innovative approaches and strategies in education. Prototype awards explore potentially innovative approaches and strategies in education. Both types of Partnerships incorporate significant new innovations to STEM education, linked to a strong educational research agenda, in one of four focal areas: Community Enterprise for STEM Learning; Current Issues Related to STEM Content; Identifying and Cultivating Exceptional Talent; and K-12 STEM Teacher Preparation. In addition, there are three types of Research, Evaluation and Technical Assistance (RETA) project opportunities in this solicitation: research related to sustainability, or policies, or state plans for STEM education; technical assistance for evaluators of MSP projects; and the STEM Education Resource Collaboratory.",

          "Description": "This program is a continuation of the Plant Genome Research Program (PGRP) that began in FY 1998 as part of the National Plant Genome Initiative (NPGI). Since the inception of the NPGI and the PGRP, there has been a tremendous increase in the availability of functional genomics tools and sequence resources for use in the study of key crop plants and their models. Proposals are welcomed that build on these resources to develop conceptually new and different ideas and strategies to address grand challenge questions in plants of economic importance on a genome-wide scale. There is also a continued need for the development of novel and creative tools to facilitate new experimental approaches or new ways of analyzing genomic data. Especially encouraged are proposals that provide strong and novel training opportunities integral to the research plan and particularly across disciplines that include, but are not limited to, plant physiology, quantitative genetics, biochemistry, bioinformatics and engineering. Three kinds of activity will be supported in FY 2012: (1) Genomics-empowered plant research to tackle fundamental questions in plant and agricultural sciences on a genome-wide scale; (2) Development of tools and resources for plant genome research including novel technologies and analysis tools that will enable discovery; and (3) Mid-Career Investigator Awards in Plant Genome Research (MCA-PGR) to increase participation of investigators trained primarily in fields other than plant genomics. Proposals addressing these opportunities are welcomed at all scales, from single-investigator projects through multi-investigator, multi-institution projects, commensurate with the scope of the work proposed. The PGRP encourages proposals from investigators and institutions that have not participated in the program before. Proposals are encouraged from early-career investigators and proposals submitted to the CAREER program (http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503214&amp;amp;org=BIO) are considered by the PGRP. Early-career investigators are strongly encouraged to contact a PGRP Program Director for further guidance.",

          "Description": "The President&amp;#146;s Plan for Emergency AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) has made country ownership and sustainability key priorities for implementing the PEPFAR Blueprint . In order to achieve this, PEPFAR programs will need to identify all available resources at the country level. While faith-based organizations (FBOs) have been essential partners with PEPFAR in providing a substantial proportion of HIV prevention, treatment, and support services, their distinctive resources must be fully maximized at local, regional, and national levels. Due to limited capacity, the full range of key HIV services are not accessible to the population-at-large, including vulnerable and marginalized communities; however, these barriers to accessibility are not simply due to limited capacity. Social-structural and cultural factors also present barriers to the full implementation of the PEPFAR Blueprint. Faith-based organizations and faith-based health systems offer distinctive resources for addressing those barriers and must be key collaborators with PEPFAR and in-country partners. This funding opportunity announcement (FOA) supports the integration of FBOs into PEPFAR&amp;#146;s efforts to meet the objectives spelled out in the Blueprint by building their capacity and by strengthening multi-sectoral collaboration in support of evidence-based public health responses to HIV.",

Linkage is defined as the process of identifying new HIV positive clients through a bidirectional relationship among index case testing service outlets and HIV/AIDS care and treatment facilities, enrolling newly diagnosed HIV clients into appropriate chronic care by using referral slip and/or escorting of all newly identified HIV clients to appropriate care, treatment and support services. The care and support services will serve to improve clients ART adherence, and overall quality of life of persons living with HIV (PLHIV) and their families. This in turn will reduce new HIV infections, improve the quality of life for PLHIVs, and mitigate the negative health, psychological, social, and economic impacts of HIV infection in the long term.",

          "Description": "The Kingdom of Lesotho has a population of 1.9 million people. With a gender differentiated but generalized HIV epidemic, Lesotho has the world&amp;#146;s third highest HIV prevalence at 23.3%, and the world&amp;#146;s fifth highest TB-HIV co-infection rates. According to UNAIDS 2012 estimates, more than 360,000 people (includes 38,000 children under the age of 15) are estimated to be living with HIV. Lesotho has made significant improvements in reducing AIDS related mortality from 26,000 in 2005 to less than 16,000 in 2012. The overall goal of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to utilize a district model approach to scale-up HIV prevention and treatment interventions to create an AIDS free generation in four districts in Lesotho. This will be achieved by implementing interventions to expand coverage of provider-initiated testing and counseling (PITC) and linkage into care services and treatment; reduce the rate of mother to child transmission to less than 5% and keep the mother-baby pairs alive; increase coverage of HIV treatment both to reduce AIDS-related mortality and to enhance HIV prevention; ensure that all TB-HIV co-infected people are initiated on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and retained in care; and strengthen the capacity of District Health Management Teams (DHMT) to routinely deliver high quality HIV programs in each district. The goal and activities of this FOA are in alignment with the Lesotho National HIV/AIDS Strategic Plan (NSP) . The four service districts will be Leribe, Berea, Quithing, and Qacha&amp;#146;s Nek, which have a combined estimated population of 750,000.",

Up to 40 years of additional tide data exists in the US National Archives for various long-term tide gages around the country, but that data has been unavailable and un-analyzed for more than a century. Within this work effort, benchmark and datum records will be recovered and tied to the modern record. The goal of this work is to recover important pre-digital historical tidal data that up to this point has not been available for analysis and to help define how extreme water levels (such as the 10 year or 100 year return period event) are evolving at locations around the country. This data will be used to extend the historical record which will help provide information relevant to climate and sea level change at the various tidal stations addressed in the work. An increased tidal record can inform the public and regions of the country on expected future conditions including flood risk due to changing tides, sea level and, in some cases, river flow. This cooperative agreement will be awarded pursuant to the Water Resources Development Act of 1986 SEC 731 &amp;#150; Study of Rising Oceans.",

It is generally accepted that age is the major risk factor for most chronic diseases and degenerative conditions in adults. Thus, a critical question in geroscience is to identify components in the biology of aging that are the underlying risk for multiple chronic diseases and degenerative conditions. Therefore, this FOA will support planning grants to circumscribe the scope of this question and suggest ways to answer it experimentally. The focus will be on epigenetics underlying aging as a risk factor for age-related diseases and degenerative conditions in humans. Mortality and age-related mortality are outside the scope of this FOA. Studies using model organisms are outside the scope of this FOA.",

          "Description": "This announcement solicits applications for the &amp;#191;Strengthen Evidence Base for Maternal and Child Health Programs&amp;#191; cooperative agreement. The purpose of this program is to provide support and resources to assist State Title V Maternal and Child Health (MCH) programs in developing evidence-based or evidence-informed State Action Plans as well as in responding to the National Outcome Measures, National Performance Measures, State Performance Measures, and state-initiated Structural/Process Measures. This will facilitate the transformation of the MCH Title V Block Grant program. The activities funded under the cooperative agreement will aim to accomplish the following six goals: (1) Convene a Team of Experts who have specialty background and experience related to the topical areas addressed in the National Performance Measures such as medical home or children with special health care needs; (2) Provide a critical review of the evidence of effectiveness of possible strategies to address National Outcome Measures, National Performance Measures, State Performance Measures, and state-initiated Structural/Process Measures via the Team of Experts; (3) Provide ongoing consultation to state Title V MCH programs via the Team of Experts, to support the State&amp;#191;s development of evidence-based or evidence-informed State Action Plans; (4) Develop web-based supports and resources for State Title V (MCH) programs; (5) Establish an online platform for sharing best practices called a &amp;#191;Community of Practice,&amp;#191; which will facilitate communication and information-sharing on topics regarding the emerging needs of Title V state and discretionary grantees for implementing the Title V MCH Block Grant Transformation process; and (6) Maintain and enhance a MCH digital library to facilitate access to historical and current MCH documents from the establishment of the Children&amp;#191;s Bureau in 1912 to the enactment of Title V of the Social Security Act in 1935 and other significant documents published thereafter. The awardee will accomplish the following activities within each of the six program goals: 1. Convene a Team of Experts. The Team of Experts should have specialty experience related to the performance measures such as medical home or children with special health care needs. The awardee must establish their Team of Experts and propose the plan. The awardee will have access to peer-reviewed research, published reports, and research databases and portals to support the Team of Experts&amp;#191; activities. Team activities will include: &amp;#183; Plan and implement a thorough literature review process for required evidence-based reports. The literature review process will ensure the integrity of the recommended evidenced-based and evidenced-informed strategies; and &amp;#183; Respond to state requests for consultation and analysis regarding the identification of National and State Performance Measures, Structural/Process Measures, as well as the development of their state action plan within the context that the State programs must make continued progress to achieve the desired health status and performance outcomes. 2. Provide reports including a critical review of the evidence of effectiveness of possible strategies to address National Outcome Measures, National Performance Measures, State Performance Measures, and state-initiated Structural/Process Measures, via the Team of Experts. Literature reviewed should include peer-reviewed articles, Bureau grantee reports, white papers, and other grey literature via research methods. A definition will be applied to narrow the literature according to measure topic relevance. The final reports should include the following sections: &amp;#183; Literature Review: A literature review of research that includes peer-reviewed articles, awardee reports, white papers, and other grey literature applicable nationally or to the state requesting assistance; &amp;#183; Analysis: Analysis of available results and meta-analysis of published findings as available; &amp;#183; Recommendations: Implementation and measurement recommendations based on evidence-informed outcomes including suggestions on what works and what doesn&amp;#191;t work for state Title V MCH programs; and &amp;#183; Bibliography: Citations and links to original literature. 3. Provide ongoing consultation to state Title V MCH programs via the Team of Experts, to support the State&amp;#191;s development of evidence-based or evidence-informed State Action Plans to address the National Outcome Measures, National Performance Measures, State Performance Measures, and state-initiated Structural/Process Measures. Consultation activities should: &amp;#183; Be ongoing and responsive to the individual needs of the states as they use their National and State Performance Measures to develop their State Action Plan; and &amp;#183; Include communication mechanisims for the Team of Experts to ensure the states are receiving a thurough consultation. 4. Develop web-based supports and resources for State Title V (MCH) programs that will: &amp;#183; Be publically available; &amp;#183; House all of the evidence-based and evidence-informed reports regarding the National and State Performance Measures and Structural/Process Measures, as well as the Community of Practice, described in activity #5; and &amp;#183; Be organized and user-friendly with a searchable engine and links to key topics. &amp;#183; Have embedded links to share via email and social media. 5.

          "Description": "The intent of the FY14 Military Risk Factors Research Award (MRFA) is to facilitate high-impact, systematic, population-based research investigating the association between TBI and the subsequent development of AD. Applications should describe how the association of TBI and subsequent AD will be characterized. Applications should also describe how the proposed study will work with well-defined, already identified study cohorts. Applications should carefully consider how their studies will characterize the cognitive and behavioral symptoms that result in functional impairments in the proposed cohort. Studies that use combinations of measures (e.g., neuropsychological assessments, imaging, genomics, and cerebral spinal fluid) are encouraged. Applications that develop interdisciplinary teams or consortia as part of the support plan for executing the research are encouraged. Important Note: Applications must detail and demonstrate expedited access to a well-defined, already identified study cohort. Preliminary data that supports how the cohort will be used in the study is also required. The preliminary data must strongly support the proposed research hypothesis (or hypotheses). Refer to the Review Criteria in this Program Announcement/ Funding Opportunity for details. Overarching Challenge: This MRFA funding opportunity requires applications to address the following PRARP Overarching Challenge: Paucity of Clinical Studies: The paucity of clinical studies and other research resources to examine the interrelationship between TBI and subsequent AD for military Veterans/other individuals affected by TBI. Focus Areas: In addition to addressing the Overarching Challenge, applications must also address at least one of the following FY14 PRARP Focus Areas in support of the Overarching Challenge. An application that proposes research outside of these Focus Areas is acceptable, as long as the applicant provides a strong rationale: Genomics/Proteomics/Bioinformatics: Studies or technologies (e.g., genetic, proteomic and epigenetic strategies) intended to characterize neurological change associated with TBI and subsequent AD. In addition to studies, relevant technologies or tests may be considered under this focus area. Imaging: Development and application of anatomic and molecular imaging strategies to characterize neurological changes associated with TBI and subsequent AD While the MRFA mechanism can be used to support clinical research, the following is specifically discouraged under the FY14 PRARP: Pharmacologic Interventions: Clinical or Basic research requiring investigational or FDA-approved drugs or medicines. Drug Discovery and Development: Clinical or Basic research directly leading to the development of investigational medicines, drugs, or agents.",

          "Description": "Avian Health and Disease Program Region 7 Request for Proposals FY2012 INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS The Avian Health and Disease program (AHD) supports avian conservation, surveillance and monitoring goals of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by including health and disease assessments into activities related to the management of all migratory bird species. MATERIALS To prepare a complete Proposal, authors should have a copy of the Avian Health and Disease Program-Region 7 Request for Proposals (FY2012) and the National Strategic Plan. OBJECTIVES OF THE AVIAN HEALTH AND DISEASE PROGRAM Conduct health and disease surveillance of wild bird populations to: 1. Establish avian health baselines 2. Identify existing and emerging avian health and disease risks 3. Ensure disease preparedness and prevention 4. Develop, guide, and implement appropriate and effective management actions To address these objectives, the National Strategic Plan (NSP) (1) provides support for the following six main areas: 1. Personnel 2. Morbidity and mortality monitoring, response and technical assistance 3. Health and disease impact investigations 4. Technical assistance for management issues 5. Infrastructure and provisions needed for field operations 6. Communications and informing policy 7. Collaborations The Regional Avian Health and Disease Coordinator (acting coordinator: Russ Oates) is responsible for ensuring that Alaska&amp;#146;s AHD program is meeting the objectives and fulfilling requirements identified in the NSP. This Request for Proposals (RFP) is designed specifically to address Health and Disease Impact Investigations (Number 3 above). Although, many of the other areas, such as Morbidity and Mortality Monitoring and Response will require partnering between the Regional Office and many field stations across the state, these activities will be developed with the Coordinator and field personnel separately from this proposal process. Below are specific topics identified within the NSP that should be considered in proposals seeking funding from the R7-AHD program (2) . HEALTH AND DISEASE IMPACT INVESTIGATIONS Integrate health surveillance into field activities &amp;#149; Initiate or expand investigation of regionally specific avian health and disease problems &amp;#149; Collect baseline data on avian species to assess health and disease concerns &amp;#149; Evaluate critical avian populations: species of concern, threatened and endangered species (conduct field investigations in combination with the ongoing management activities) &amp;#149; Investigate infectious diseases (viruses, bacteria, fungal infections) &amp;#149; Investigate non-infectious diseases (parasites, biotoxins, contaminants) &amp;#149; Conduct targeted pathogen surveillance &amp;#149; Investigate indigenous and exotic disease problems Climate change &amp;#149; Incorporate AHD activities into DOI climate change strategic plans, LCCs, CCPs and other planning documents. &amp;#149; Integrate health surveillance with National Wildlife Refuges Inventories and Monitoring disease surveillance priorities &amp;#149; Investigate the impact of climate change on the biology of wildlife disease reservoirs and vector species &amp;#149; Investigate disease impacts on species adaptation strategies &amp;#149; Identify ancillary stressors influencing avian susceptibility to disease (decoupling of biological processes) Human-induced effects on disease transmission &amp;#149; Assess the increased disease risks associated with urban, suburban, and agricultural environments (water quality, habitat fragmentation, contaminants) &amp;#149; Aid in the prevention and management of invasive species introduction &amp;#149; Adjust FWS personnel behaviors during field activities to decrease the potential of disease transmission to humans, other wildlife, other geographic sites PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT Multi-year projects, up to three years will be accepted. All proposals must cover the entire scope of the project, not just the current year. Proposals can be updated each year to address any changes that may occur over the life of the project. No set budget limit exists for individual projects; however projects should try not to exceed $60,000 per year. Projects costing more than $60,000 will be considered but must be well-justified. Proposals should be 2-5 pages and include enough information for a reviewer to understand how objectives of the project will be met.

          "Description": "The purpose of this project is to construct the five extraction wells, ten groundwater compliance monitoring wells, raw water transmission pipeline, groundwater treatment facility, treated water pipeline, and six re-injection wells. The proposed treatment facility will remove contaminants from the groundwater and restore the aquifer while enhancing the water supply for the region. In addition, the project is part of a regional plan to clean up the EMOU and is recognized by the EPA in their Record of Decision as necessary for restoration of the EMOU aquifer.Project Description.This Agreement covers the activities and costs necessary for the design, permitting, and construction of the five extraction wells, ten monitoring wells, the raw water pipeline, the 250 gpm treatment facility, the treated water pipeline, and the six re-injection wells.Major components are described below.Pre-design ActivitiesThis work item includes the completion of all pre-design activities, including groundwater modeling, well design, discharge study, treatment facility design, pipeline design and groundwater monitoring.Treatment Equipment InstallationThis work item includes the installation of treatment facilities for the removal of VOC&amp;#146;s, and 1,4-Dioxane. VOC&amp;#146;s will be removed by LGAC. 1,4-Dioxane will be destroyed by an ultraviolet/chemical oxidation process. Construct Extraction Wells and Re-injection WellsThis work item includes the final activities necessary to construct the five extraction wells and six re-injection wells. These activities include construction of the wells, well development, installation of the permanent pumps and some minor piping reconfigurations.Compliance Monitoring WellsThis work item includes the installation of ten compliance monitoring wells, which are required by EPA. The wells will monitor the compliance of the shallow zone remedy as described in the Interim Record of Decision for the EMOU. Site WorkSite work will include clearing of the land, grading, modifications to existing site piping, new site piping and appurtenances, vaults, slabs on grade, chemical containment areas, electrical power and controls, and pre-engineered metal buildings.PipelinesRaw and treated water pipelines will be constructed to convey raw groundwater from the new extraction wells to the centralized treatment facility and transport the treated water to the re-injection wells.The purpose of this modification is to update the scope of work, schedule, milestone dates, completion date, and budget. This is necessary due to changes to the project details that have evolved since the agreement was executed over 8 years ago. In addition, an additional $610,000 is being obligated to the agreement. These funds were deobligated from other agreements when they were closed out.",

          "Description": "This is a notice of intent to award a single source cooperative agreement to the Chicago Wilderness Trust under justification 505DM 2.14B1 to implement a series of public events around the Great Lakes basin on climate change resiliency at the local level. The applicant, Chicago Wilderness, is a partner with many urban areas in the Great Lakes and has served as a model for a conservation alliance. Competition for the award is not practical as this project was specifically identified for funding in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Interagency Agreement. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) plans to enter into a new cooperative agreement with Chicago Wilderness Trust to provide financial support for community education relevant to increasing climate change resiliency in the Great Lakes. This project is outlined in the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative Interagency Agreement Scope of Work FY 2014 developed between the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Great Lakes National Program Office and the U.S. fish and Wildlife Service, which describes the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative (GLRI) funding allocated to the Service by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Increasing Climate Change resiliency is extremely important to communities around the Great Lakes in attempting to cope with drought, increased storm events, flooding and other effects of a changing climate. This project will bring the right science to local GLRI partners, including the public and other stakeholders, so as to ensure smart conservation investments for the future. Substantial involvement on the part of the Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the activities to be funded. In particular, the Service will partner with Chicago Wilderness to implement a series of at least 10 public events around the Great Lakes basin on climate change resiliency at the local level. These &amp;apos;climate clinics&amp;apos; will identify strategies to help GLRI practitioners respond and adapt to changes to our climate. The Chicago Wilderness strategy, &amp;quot;Climate Action Plan for Nature&amp;quot;, includes five Community Action Strategies: Climate Change Education; Stewardship; Monitoring; Water Conservation; and Climate friendly gardens and landscapes. This funding would provide the opportunity to implement these Community Action Strategies in multiple urban areas. FWS Staff will help identify relevant land managers and will participate in workshops providing their expertise in habitat restoration and wildlife vulnerability to climate change.",

          "Description": "The Office of Naval Research (ONR) is interested in receiving proposals for the Office of the Secretary of Defense (OSD)-led Minerva Research Initiative (http://minerva.dtic.mil), a DoD-sponsored, university-based social science research program initiated by the Secretary of Defense. This program is a multi-service effort. Ultimately, however, funding decisions will be made by OSD personnel, with technical inputs from the Services. The program focuses on areas of strategic importance to U.S. national security policy. It seeks to increase the Department&amp;#146;s intellectual capital in the social sciences and improve its ability to address future challenges and build bridges between the Department and the social science community. Minerva brings together universities, research institutions, and individual scholars and supports multidisciplinary and cross-institutional projects addressing specific topic areas determined by the Department of Defense. The Minerva Research Initiative aims to promote research in specific areas of social science and to promote a candid and constructive relationship between DoD and the social science academic community.The Minerva Research Initiative competition is for research related to the four (4) topics and ten (10) subtopics listed below. Detailed descriptions of the topics can be found in Section VIII, &amp;#147;Specific Minerva Research Initiative Topics.&amp;#148; The detailed descriptions are intended to provide the proposer a frame of reference and are not meant to be restrictive. Innovative proposals related to these research topics are highly encouraged. White papers and full proposals are solicited which address the following topics (described in Section VIII of this solicitation): (1) Identity, Influence, and Mobilization(1-A) Culture, identity, and security(1-B) Belief formation and influence(1-C) Mobilization for change(2) Contributors to Societal Resilience and Change(2-A) Governance and rule of law(2-B) Resources, economics, and globalization(2-C) Additional factors impacting societal resilience and change(3) Power and Deterrence(3-A) Power projection and diffusion (3-B) Beyond conventional deterrence(4) Innovations in National Security, Conflict, and Cooperation (4-A) Analytical methods and metrics for security research(4-B) Emerging topics in conflict and securityProposals will be considered both for single-investigator awards as well as larger teams. A team of university investigators may be warranted because the necessary expertise in addressing the multiple facets of the topics may reside in different universities, or in different departments of the same university. The research questions addressed should extend across a fairly broad range of linked issues where there is clear potential synergy among the contributions of the distinct disciplines represented on the team. Team proposals must name one Principal Investigator as the responsible technical point of contact. Similarly, one institution will be the primary recipient for the purpose of award execution. The relationship among participating institutions and their respective roles, as well as the apportionment of funds including sub-awards, if any, must be described in both the proposal text and the budget.

          "Description": "The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to invite applications for the Consortium on Biomarkers and Outcome Measures of Social Impairment in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in order to generate objective tools for use in clinical trials of behavioral or pharmacologic interventions. The FOA will support a Consortium project to conduct a multi-site study to assess a well-justified set of standardized lab-based measures of domains of social impairment and biological measures (resting state and task-based EEG as well as eye tracking measures) that show promise in school age individuals with ASD at baseline, 6 and 24 week time points. The intent of the FOA is to qualify a set of measures that can be used as stratification biomarkers and/or as sensitive and reliable objective measures of social impairment in ASD clinical trials. A key goal of the Consortium projectis to provide a community resource for broad sharing of all data generated including processed/analyzed data, with rapid and timely deposition of data into the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR). All data generated in this project are expected to be deposited in NDAR and will be accessible for use by all qualified investigators. In addition, blood (DNA) samples are expected to be deposited in the NIMH Repository and Genomics Resource for future research use.The Consortium project will assess the following: (1) whether lab-based measures of specific domains of social impairment in ASD are more sensitive indicators of clinical status compared to commonly used clinician and caregiver assessments of social impairment for their potential use as outcome measures in clinical trials; (2) whether eye-tracking, electrophysiological (EEG) paradigms, or a combination of the two, have potential utility as stratification biomarkers and/or as sensitive and reliable measures of change in ASD clinical trials; (3) the relationship (correlation) of lab-based measures of domains of social impairment to eye tracking or EEG (resting state and task-based) paradigms; and (4) the relationship (correlation) of lab-based measures of domains of social impairment to commonly used clinician and caregiver assessments of social impairment. In addition, the FOA includes a resource aim for the collection of blood (DNA) samples from all subjects, including the parents of ASD subjects, for future genomic analyses.",

Unless otherwise specified herein, the terms and conditions as stated in the Cooperative Agreement will apply to this Task Agreement. Interagency Partnership &amp;#191; Hands on the Land (HOL) is a national network of field classrooms and agency resources that is managed by NEEF and connects students, teachers, families, and volunteers with public lands and waterways. HOL sites customize hands-on experiences using local natural, historical and archaeological settings to bring classroom learning to life. National Park sites monitor ecological and natural resources trends and specific biota. This type of work relies upon Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) skills and the data generated can be transferred, adapted and applied by students. RECIPIENT INVOLVEMENT NPS and US Department of Education (ED) wish to expand upon a partnership that supports and enhances STEM programming within ED&amp;apos;s 21st Century Community Learning Center (21st CCLC) program. Through this collaboration, NPS and ED will continue to advance mutual STEM education goals by providing access to natural resource monitoring and citizen science programs in our national parks to students in Bureau of Indian Education (BIE) tribal grantee schools that are geographically close to NPS units.. In order to implement these programs, NPS will work with an environmental education organization such as HOL - a national program created by Partners in Resource Education and managed by the NEEF that connects schools with public land agencies for the purposes of exposing students to the environment. National park units, HOL, and ED&amp;#191;s 21st CCLC grantees will work collaboratively to integrate STEM skills into 21st CCLC programming and offer students the opportunity to have authentic STEM experiences in a national park. The overarching goal for the interagency collaboration is to align resources between the agencies to address the national need for a STEM-educated workforce. The objective of the project is to improve the retention of students in STEM disciplines by providing opportunities and activities that motivate and inspire students to take an interest in STEM. This goal and objective is to &amp;#191;provide multiple ways for children to learn about the national parks and what they reveal about nature, the nation&amp;#191;s history, and issues central to our civic life the goal of &amp;#191;bringing our public lands to the classrooms and the classrooms to our public lands.&amp;#191; This is mutually beneficial to ED&amp;apos;s own mission to &amp;#191;promote student achievement and preparation for global competitiveness&amp;#191; by inspiring more of tomorrow&amp;apos;s workforce to pursue STEM-related subjects and fields. This work will be evaluated by a professional evaluator which is integrated into this plan. A. Hands on the Land network agrees to: &amp;#191; Select and support 5 NPS units within the HOL network that will provide afterschool STEM opportunities to BIE tribal schools that are 21st CCLC grantees; &amp;#191; Provide a list of points of contact for each participating state and site to coordinate training, evaluation, and student work submission to ED; &amp;#191; Provide environmental monitoring and citizen science training to 21 CCLC site staff members and park unit staff; &amp;#191; In collaboration with NPS, create and deliver blended professional development for sites and park units around environmental monitoring and citizen science that reflect best practices for training. In person and online training sessions will begin in November 2014; &amp;#191; Develop and/or expand monitoring and citizen science projects for park units and partner 21 CCLC sites. &amp;#191; Collaborate with NPS in selecting, designing and implementing an evaluation of the program&amp;#191;s effectiveness to be accomplished by an external evaluator; &amp;#191; Develop best practice guidelines or standards for student environmental monitoring and citizen science participation to build capacity for educational excellence across the network; &amp;#191; Expand HOL&amp;#191;s online presence by developing or expanding monitoring projects, mentoring, linking within the Internet social networks and within federal agency websites. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE INVOLVEMENT Substantial involvement on the part the National Park Service is anticipated for the successful completion of the objectives to be funded by this award. In particular, the National Park Service will be responsible for the following: NPS will continue to implement a STEM program that draws from science based monitoring work and similar activities that are ongoing in national parks. Specifically, NPS will: &amp;#191; Collaborate with NEEF and HOL to determine selection criteria for external evaluator and input towards final approval of external evaluator. &amp;#191; Coordinate biweekly calls with NEEF to discuss coordination, progress, challenges and associated mitigation strategies; and formally review performance data (Cost, Technical, Schedule) on a monthly basis. &amp;#191; Modify existing programs and associated curriculum materials (educator guides, rubrics, student instructions) as needed to emphasize STEM skills, address 21st CCLC program objectives and meet the needs of 21st CCLC partner sites. &amp;#191; Provide technical support and professional development to participating NPS HOL sites collaborating with ED&amp;apos;s 21st CCLC program. Assist participating 21st CCLC sites with integrating HOL and their local national park into programming. &amp;#191; Develop a collaborative citizen science project to be undertaken by each park and its partner 21st CCLC site. One example would be to have students help expand the scope and reach of environmental monitoring that is ongoing in many of our national parks. Water quality monitoring, ground level ozone monitoring and conducting inventories of living species are examples of monitoring projects. &amp;#191; Provide 21st CCLC sites with regular opportunities to interact in person with NPS STEM experts at their local partner park. NPS will work with ED, HOL, and the 21st CCLC sites to determine an engagement schedule that is mutually beneficial. &amp;#191; Select exemplary student work to showcase in media advisories and on nps.gov SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award. The justification must address one or more of the following criteria as well as discussion of the program legislative history, unique capabilities of the proposed recipient, and cost-sharing contribution offered by the proposed recipient, as applicable. In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria: (1) Unsolicited Proposal &amp;#191; The proposed award is the result of an unsolicited assistance application which represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach which is not the subject of a current or planned contract or assistance award, but which is deemed advantageous to the program objectives; (2) Continuation &amp;#191; The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation of an activity presently being funded, and for which competition would have a significant adverse effect on the continuity or completion of the activity; (3) Legislative intent &amp;#191; The language in the applicable authorizing legislation or legislative history clearly indicates Congress&amp;#191; intent to restrict the award to a particular recipient of purpose; (4) Unique Qualifications &amp;#191; The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon a variety of demonstrable factors such as location, property ownership, voluntary support capacity, cost-sharing ability if applicable, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications; (5) Emergencies &amp;#191; Program/award where there is insufficient time available (due to a compelling and unusual urgency, or substantial danger to health or safety) for adequate competitive procedures to be followed.

          "Description": "The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters, Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) will be releasing an umbrella NASA Research Announcement (NRA) titled &amp;quot;Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion-2015 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2015)&amp;quot; in October 2014. The NRA will be accessible from the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES) website, (http://nspires.nasaprs.com ) by linking through the menu listing &amp;quot;Solicitations&amp;quot;, and then selecting &amp;quot;Open Solicitations&amp;quot; and finally selecting &amp;quot;Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion-2015 (SpaceTech-REDDI-2015).&amp;quot; Under SpaceTech-REDDI-2015, proposals will be solicited through Appendices which will be issued as technology topics are defined and funding is made available for new opportunities. Once new Appendices are released, interested parties will be able to access them by clicking through the Open S olicitations link, then selecting &amp;quot;NRA NNH15ZOA001N&amp;quot;, and then selecting &amp;quot;List of Open Program Elements&amp;quot;. It is anticipated that this umbrella solicitation (SpaceTech-REDDI-2015) will be open for one year (through October 2015) and follow-up umbrella SpaceTech-REDDI solicitations will be issued annually at about the same time. The STMD portfolio supports a combination of early-stage studies, for assessing the feasibility of entirely new technologies (which corresponds to a technology readiness level (TRL) range from 1 to 3); maturing feasible technologies through rapid competitive development and ground-based testing (TRL 3-5); and flight demonstrations in relevant environments to complete the final steps prior to mission infusion (TRL 5-7). This technological diversity results in a sustainable pipeline of revolutionary concepts. STMD seeks aggressive technology development efforts that may require undertaking significant technical challenges and risk to achieve a higher potential payoff. The following STMD programs will be included in the SpaceTech-REDDI-2015 umbrella solicitation: * NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) Program focuses on visionary aeronautics and space system concepts. TRL Range: 1-3 -- Appendix A1: NIAC Phase I Call for Proposals -- Appendix A2: NIAC Phase II Call for Proposals * Space Technology Research Grants (STRGP) Program engages academia in innovative research in advanced space technology. TRL Range: 1-3 -- Appendix B1: Early Career Faculty (ECF) -- Appendix B2: Early Stage Innovations (ESI) * Game Changing Development (GCD) Program focuses on maturing advanced space technologies that may lead to entirely new approaches for the Agency&amp;apos;s future space missions. TRL Range: 3-5 -- Appendix C1: Game Changing Technology Topic TBD -- Appendix C2: Game Changing Technology Topic TBD -- Appendix C3: Game Changing Technology Topic TBD -- Appendix C4: Game Changing Technology Topic TBD * Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) Program seeks to mature laboratory-proven technologies to flight-ready status. TRL Range: 5-7 -- Appendix D1: Topic TBD * Small Spacecraft Technology (SST) Program develops and demonstrates subsystem technologies and new mission capabilities for small spacecraft. TRL Range: 3-7 -- Appendix E1: Small Spacecraft Technology Development and Demonstration -- Appendix E2: Smallsat Technology Partnerships * Flight Opportunities Program (FOP) facilitates low-cost access to suborbital environments for a broad range of innovators as a means of advancing space technology development and supporting the evolving entrepreneurial commercial space industry. TRL Range: 5-7 -- Appendix F1: FOP Technology Topic TBD Additional information about the STMD Programs is available at http://www.nasa.gov/spacetech . The SpaceTech-REDDI-2015 solicitation will contain target release dates for the Appendices that will be solicited in that year. To the greatest extent practicable, participation will be open to all categories of organizations, domestic and foreign, including industry, educational institutions, nonprofit organizations, NASA Centers, and other Government agencies. Foreign entities may also partner with US proposers, but only without the exchange of funding. The Appendices will provide details of the solicited opportunities including: specific scope of the work solicited, anticipated budget for new awards, number of awards anticipated, notice of intent and proposal due dates, and specific instructions about proposal content and evaluation criteria. The number and value of awards will depend on the availability of funds and the quality of proposals received. This is a broad agency announcement as specified in FAR 35.016 and NFS 1835.016. Notwithstanding the posting of this opportunity at FedBizOpps.gov and Grants.gov, NASA reserves the right to determine the appropriate award instrument for each proposa l selected pursuant to the NRA. The individual Program Officers and assigned Contracting Officers will be listed in the each Appendix.

          "Description": "Introduction: The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an Agency of the Department of Agriculture, works with private landowners through conservation planning and assistance designed to benefit soil, water, air, plants, and animals that result in productive lands and healthy ecosystems. NRCS&amp;apos;s natural resources conservation programs help land owners reduce soil erosion, enhance water supplies, improve water quality, increase wildlife habitat, and reduce damages caused by floods and other natural disasters. Background: In the Lake Tahoe Basin, which spans portions of two counties in California and two counties and one rural area in Nevada, a major resource concern is water quality and the alarming decline in the clarity of Lake Tahoe. Experts estimate that approximately 72% the fine sediment that enters the Lake originates from urban area runoff.Single-family residential parcels that have been &amp;#147;hardened&amp;#148; by impervious surfaces such as roads, driveways, and rooftops contribute sediment and nutrients to Lake Tahoe at an accelerated rate, impairing water quality. Local regulations require that all existing single-family residential properties will be retrofitted with Best Management Practices (BMP&amp;#146;s) designed to infiltrate runoff from a 20 year (1 inch per hour) storm event, on-site. BMP&amp;#146;s may include paving driveways and parking pads, infiltration trenches and dry wells, adequate vegetation cover and stabilized slopes. Applicants will be responsible for working in conjunction with NRCS to provide technical assistance through the Community Watershed Partnership program as described in the statement of work.NRCS expects to award one cooperative agreement (one in California and one in Nevada) based on proposals submitted and benefits derived for the current fiscal year. The funding ceiling available for the current fiscal year is: $350,000 for the California side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Any agreements resulting from this solicitation will have a one-year base period. Activities under this cooperative agreement(s) will be carried out from approximately January 30, 2012 through February 28, 2013. Scope of Work: The successful applicant will: 1. Complete a minimum of 233 &amp;#145;Site Evaluation Plans&amp;#146; and 266 unique APN tech assists.While support will target selected watersheds, a minimum of 25% of the project will support basin wide requests for providing assistance for the tasks mentioned above. &amp;#147;Site Evaluation Plans&amp;#146; are site specific plans, in compliance with all local and state regulations, to meet the objectives of the &amp;#145;Best Management Practice&amp;#146; Retrofit Program (BMP) in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each site plan will be based on activities such as, but not limited to making field visits to perform inventory and evaluation, recording measurements and calculations, analyzing data, prescribing appropriate conservation practices (and alternatives, where feasible), and recording the property owner&amp;#146;s record of decision.Site Evaluation Plans will follow a standard format as provided by NRCS, be maintained on a computer database, be made available to NRCS electronically, and the electronic version will be compatible with Microsoft Access. Copies of the Site Evaluation Plans will also be provided to the property owner. As legal provisions are met, data will be forwarded to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.Site Evaluation format includes the following components: customer contact information, GIS derived environmental data, technical assistance notes, a Site Map with all pertinent features recorded to analyze storm water runoff from impervious surfaces, a list of recommended treatments, a Site Drawing showing recommended BMP treatments, photos documenting pre-installation of BMP conditions, and calculations used to determine the amount of runoff generated from impervious surfaces. These calculations are used to size recommended practices for BMP Retrofit. A letter to the homeowner is also generated, explaining the recommendations and procedures for completing their project.2. Develop and implement an education and outreach plan, commensurate with the number of stakeholders in a minimum of two target areas.The program must be approved by NRCS and may include such things as workshops, media articles and other public events, as well as meeting with individual clients.3. Collect and analyze information through surveys, personal contact, or other means to assess the needs of the community and provide direction for the program.A minimum of two watersheds or areas will be targeted through Community Watershed Partnership in California. Community engagement is a vital component of the program. The successful applicant will work with the NRCS to host community forums, develop website content, and develop and process community surveys. The successful applicant will participate in interagency meetings to coordinate delivery of the Community Watershed Partnership program as necessary.4. Submit quarterly reports of progress tracking progress on all tasks and submit a year-end report documenting accomplishments. 5. Create a report for each watershed or area on the accomplishments of the Community Watershed Partnership as well as goals and strategies for conservation of the watershed or community area. This document will be for public distribution. All services provided in conservation planning, conservation practice application or verification, and other technical assistance must meet USDA-NRCS standards and specifications as set forth in the NRCS regulations. (For more information on these regulations see: www.nrcs.usda.gov) NRCS will be substantially involved in carrying out the work covered by this cooperative agreement. NRCS will also provide a representative to participate in the planning and management of the cooperative agreement and coordinate activities. NRCS will provide oversight and as necessary, agency software, forms, and other resource information.Evaluation Criteria &amp;#150; Listed in Descending Order of Importance1. Organizational Capabilities &amp;#150; the adequacy of organizational resources and experience to successfully manage and perform the project. This includes background and experiences of staff that will completes the tasks in a professional manner and reflect a positive image of NRCS. 2. Knowledge of conservation issues in the Lake Tahoe Basin and NRCS practice standards and specifications related to those conservation issues.3. Ability to work with NRCS and watershed stakeholders on conservation issues.4. Knowledge of local and State ordinances and regulations related to implementing conservation practices in the Lake Tahoe Basin.Each proposal will be evaluated and ranked in accordance with the evaluation factors listed above. Discussions may be held with each applicant regarding the applicant&amp;#146;s experience, the proposed plan of action or alternative courses of action. After selection, NRCS will enter into negotiations with the selected applicant to discuss cost and the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement to be signed.",

          "Description": "The purpose of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to build upon civil registration and vital statistics (CRVS), which is based on international standards, and being implemented in three Districts located in the Northern, Central and Southern regions of Malawi. The 3 District demonstration project was supported by funding from the Office of the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) under a Strategic Information Central Initiative. Under this initiative, the project targeted 3 Districts, and the National level, for the following baseline achievements: (1) National and District rapid assessments, (2) a National strategic plan, (3) trainings and capacity development, and (4) process and tool improvements. Building upon this baseline work, the FOA aims to strengthen the 3 District demonstration and further scale operations to 15 new Districts over a 5-year period. Achieving scale requires sustaining existing activities and introducing new ones aimed at strengthening Malawi&amp;#146;s CRVS organizational and governance infrastructure; improving facility and community based civil registration, vital statistics production using an electronic system; and advancing systems-wide advocacy and key partner collaborations. The expected outcomes of this FOA are: improved sustainability of CRVS operations, increased birth and death registrations, and the timely reporting and use of vital statistics.",

          "Description": "Introduction: The Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), an Agency of the Department of Agriculture, works with private landowners through conservation planning and assistance designed to benefit soil, water, air, plants, and animals that result in productive lands and healthy ecosystems. NRCS&amp;apos;s natural resources conservation programs help land owners reduce soil erosion, enhance water supplies, improve water quality, increase wildlife habitat, and reduce damages caused by floods and other natural disasters. Background: In the Lake Tahoe Basin, which spans portions of two counties in California and two counties and one rural area in Nevada, a major resource concern is water quality and the alarming decline in the clarity of Lake Tahoe. Experts estimate that approximately 72% the fine sediment that enters the Lake originates from urban area runoff.Single-family residential parcels that have been &amp;#147;hardened&amp;#148; by impervious surfaces such as roads, driveways, and rooftops contribute sediment and nutrients to Lake Tahoe at an accelerated rate, impairing water quality. Local regulations require that all existing single-family residential properties will be retrofitted with Best Management Practices (BMP&amp;#146;s) designed to infiltrate runoff from a 20 year (1 inch per hour) storm event, on-site. BMP&amp;#146;s may include paving driveways and parking pads, infiltration trenches and dry wells, adequate vegetation cover and stabilized slopes. Applicants will be responsible for working in conjunction with NRCS to provide technical assistance through the Community Watershed Partnership program as described in the statement of work.NRCS expects to award one cooperative agreement (one in California and one in Nevada) based on proposals submitted and benefits derived for the current fiscal year. The funding ceiling available for the current fiscal year is: $175,000 for the Nevada side of the Lake Tahoe Basin. Any agreements resulting from this solicitation will have a one-year base period. Activities under this cooperative agreement(s) will be carried out from approximately January 30, 2012 through February 28, 2013. Scope of Work: The successful applicant will: 1. Complete a minimum of 116 &amp;#145;Site Evaluation Plans&amp;#146; and 133 unique APN tech assists.While support will target selected watersheds, a minimum of 25% of the project will support basin wide requests for providing assistance for the tasks mentioned above. &amp;#147;Site Evaluation Plans&amp;#146; are site specific plans, in compliance with all local and state regulations, to meet the objectives of the &amp;#145;Best Management Practice&amp;#146; Retrofit Program (BMP) in the Lake Tahoe Basin. Each site plan will be based on activities such as, but not limited to making field visits to perform inventory and evaluation, recording measurements and calculations, analyzing data, prescribing appropriate conservation practices (and alternatives, where feasible), and recording the property owner&amp;#146;s record of decision.Site Evaluation Plans will follow a standard format as provided by NRCS, be maintained on a computer database, be made available to NRCS electronically, and the electronic version will be compatible with Microsoft Access. Copies of the Site Evaluation Plans will also be provided to the property owner. As legal provisions are met, data will be forwarded to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency.Site Evaluation format includes the following components: customer contact information, GIS derived environmental data, technical assistance notes, a Site Map with all pertinent features recorded to analyze storm water runoff from impervious surfaces, a list of recommended treatments, a Site Drawing showing recommended BMP treatments, photos documenting pre-installation of BMP conditions, and calculations used to determine the amount of runoff generated from impervious surfaces. These calculations are used to size recommended practices for BMP Retrofit. A letter to the homeowner is also generated, explaining the recommendations and procedures for completing their project.2. Develop and implement an education and outreach plan, commensurate with the number of stakeholders in the targeted area.The program must be approved by NRCS and may include such things as workshops, media articles and other public events, as well as meeting with individual clients.3. Collect and analyze information through surveys, personal contact, or other means to assess the needs of the community and provide direction for the program.Community engagement is a vital component of the Community Watershed Program. The successful applicant will work with the NRCS to host community forums, develop website content, and develop and process community surveys. The successful applicant will participate in interagency meetings to coordinate delivery of the Community Watershed Partnership program as necessary.4. Submit quarterly reports of progress tracking progress on all tasks and submit a year-end report documenting accomplishments. 5. Create a report on the accomplishments of the Community Watershed Partnership as well as goals and strategies for conservation of the watershed or community area. This document will be for public distribution. All services provided in conservation planning, conservation practice application or verification, and other technical assistance must meet USDA-NRCS standards and specifications as set forth in the NRCS regulations. (For more information on these regulations see: www.nrcs.usda.gov) NRCS will be substantially involved in carrying out the work covered by this cooperative agreement. NRCS will also provide a representative to participate in the planning and management of the cooperative agreement and coordinate activities. NRCS will provide oversight and as necessary, agency software, forms, and other resource information.Evaluation Criteria &amp;#150; Listed in Descending Order of Importance1. Organizational Capabilities &amp;#150; the adequacy of organizational resources and experience to successfully manage and perform the project. This includes background and experiences of staff that will completes the tasks in a professional manner and reflect a positive image of NRCS. 2. Knowledge of conservation issues in the Lake Tahoe Basin and NRCS practice standards and specifications related to those conservation issues.3. Ability to work with NRCS and watershed stakeholders on conservation issues.4. Knowledge of local and State ordinances and regulations related to implementing conservation practices in the Lake Tahoe Basin.Each proposal will be evaluated and ranked in accordance with the evaluation factors listed above. Discussions may be held with each applicant regarding the applicant&amp;#146;s experience, the proposed plan of action or alternative courses of action. After selection, NRCS will enter into negotiations with the selected applicant to discuss cost and the terms and conditions of the cooperative agreement to be signed.",

          "Description": "Information systems are foundational to PEPFAR activities. Over the past eight years, counseling and testing have identified millions of people with HIV/AIDS and anti-retroviral therapy (ART) has extended the life span of people living with HIV (PLWH). Due to this impact, electronic systems are essential to manage the volume of patient data. Electronic medical records (EMR), laboratory information systems (LIS), and other patient-level systems are being implemented. This growth has created a greater need to standardize functional and technical requirements for health information systems, design systems that facilitate and enable interoperability between different systems (e.g., EMRs, LIS, HRIS, pharmacy, and others), facilitate linkage and de-duplication of records, strengthen data quality and completeness, and data security, privacy, and confidentiality measures. This work will be done partly through innovative technical solutions. Most of the work will be accomplished through strengthening strategic planning and governance, developing in-country human capacity, and on-going evaluation of health information system implementations to identify effective informatics practices, efficiencies gained, health impacts and increased sustainability and country ownership. The goal of this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) is to support the design, development, implementation and use of health information systems (HIS), such as electronic medical records (EMR), human resource information systems (HRIS), district health information systems (DHIS), electronic case-based surveillance systems and health and other health-related information systems used to implement or monitor PEPFAR programs. The FOA will support the development of policy, governance, and architecture needed to implement information systems, including those needed to standardize, exchange and share data needed to improve health through evidence-based decisions. Key components of this mechanism will address issues of interoperability, human and infrastructure capacity development, planning and policy, and evaluation of the system and cost-effectiveness of HIS.",

          "Description": "As PEPFAR focuses greater attention on country ownership and the transition of full responsibility for the HIV response to partner governments, there is a need to capacitate PEPFAR host countries to be able to independently manage and sustain HIV prevention, care, and treatment programs. However, gaps in leadership and management capabilities exist and can seriously derail these efforts. Conversely, enhanced management and leadership can increase the efficiency and effectiveness of systems, maximizing the use of scarce resources. Building on work accomplished through previous capacity building efforts, this funding opportunity announcement (FOA) aims to enhance capacity of host country governments to independently manage and lead an effective response to their HIV epidemics. The awardee will work with host country governments in up to 16 PEPFAR supported countries and regional offices that may include Ethiopia, Tanzania, Mozambique, Guyana, Haiti, Zambia, Botswana, Caribbean or Central America regions at the national and sub-national levels through a peer-to-peer model for technical assistance (TA) delivery in which those delivering technical assistance have worked in comparable public sector positions and have expertise in planning, implementing, and evaluating public sector responses to the HIV epidemic. This effective approach to capacity building, successfully utilized in past PEPFAR-supported capacity building programs, focuses on: assessing needs and identification of gaps in leadership and management competencies; developing new or modifying existing tools to address the gaps identified; working with host countries on the implementation of these tools; developing and using metrics to measure increases in competencies, as well as impact over time; and using data for evidence-based decision making. The awardee will work directly with host country governments and 2-3 local partners per country throughout the five year award period to deliver peer-to-peer technical assistance. By the end of the project period, it is expected that the awardee will have achieved the following goals listed below.",

Awards are not renewable and they are not transferable from one principal investigator (PI) to another. The Diversity Training Branch (DTB) of the Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities (CRCHD), at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), invites career development award applications (K01) from individuals representative of groups that have been shown to be underrepresented in health-related science, who have been recipients of an NIH Research Supplement to Promote Diversity Award, any Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (individual F31/F32 or institutional T32), or can demonstrate that they have been supported in a mentored capacity within any research grant equivalent to an NIH peer-reviewed research grant (e.g., American Cancer Society [ACS] research grant). Candidates with clinical degrees (e.g., MD) may wish to consider the NCI Mentored Clinical Scientist Award to Promote Diversity Award (K08) and candidates interested in patient-oriented research may wish to consider the NCI Mentored Patient-Oriented Research to Promote Diversity Award (K23) as more appropriate alternatives relative to their stage of development and career goals.",

Funding for this purpose comes through the NOAA Marine Debris Program as appropriations to the Office of Response and Restoration, National Ocean Service. The funding is, in part, administered through a grant competition with the NOAA Restoration Center&amp;#146;s Community-based Restoration Program. Projects awarded through this grant competition have strong on-the-ground habitat restoration components involving the removal of marine debris, including derelict fishing gear. Projects also provide benefits to coastal communities, and create long-term ecological habitat improvements for NOAA trust resources. Through this solicitation NOAA identifies marine debris removal projects, strengthens the development and implementation of habitat restoration through community-based marine debris removal, and fosters awareness of the effects of marine debris to further the conservation of living marine resource habitats, as well as contribute to the understanding of debris types and impacts. Successful proposals through this solicitation will be funded through cooperative agreements. Funding of up to $2,000,000 is expected to be available for Community-based Marine Debris Removal Project Grants in FY2015. Typical awards will range from $50,000 to $150,000.",

The primary purpose of the WMGBP is to support activities that will improve management of the 16 species of migratory shore and upland game birds (MSUGBs, Table 1) in North America. The Migratory Shore and Upland Game Bird Support Task Force, organized through the Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies, developed a set of priority information needs by convening a series of workshops. The workshops included broad representation (i.e., federal and state agencies, conservation organizations, and university researchers) familiar with the research and management needs for these species. Priorities identified at the workshops (see Appendix A for a list of priorities) should be used to guide proposal development and will be used by the review committee to select projects that address these priority information needs. Priorities are available at or by contacting the program manager listed in Section IV. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service will oversee the WMGBP including administration of grants, purchase orders, and contracts for projects.",

          "Description": "This initiative invites applications for support of analyses of existing data (or data whose collection will be completed by one year from the date of this FOA) from older populations with high prevalence of mobility disability, low muscle mass, and low muscle strength (weakness). Interventions targeted at low muscle mass and/or weakness may prevent or reduce mobility disability in some older persons. To assess the efficacy of such interventions against mobility disability, there is a need to test them in persons in whom muscle mass and/or strength are (or will be) sufficiently low to be likely contributors to disability. Thus there is a need for evidence-based diagnostic cut-points to define target populations for treatments. Applications submitted in response to this FOA should support development and evaluation of diagnostic cut-points based on analyses of relations of mobility disability to muscle mass and strength. These analyses should extend and expand upon analyses to date on this topic, which have identified and proposed cut-points for low muscle mass and weakness. Studies supported through this FOA should clarify relations between muscle mass and strength, impaired physical function, and mobility disability, and their implications for setting diagnostic cut-points, through analyses of data from populations with substantially more individuals with mobility disability than were included in previous analyses. Applicants are encouraged to consider combining datasets from multiple populations that contain information on all of the following: at least one objective measure of muscle mass at the same anatomic site(s) common to all included studies, at least one direct measure of muscle strength common to included data sets, gait speed, and self-reported mobility status in populations of older adults. Analyses of relations to other measures of strength, muscle power, and physical performance (e.g., Short Physical Performance Battery), and mobility disability are encouraged.",

No federal funds are provided for research under this notification. Rather, proceeds generated from the sale of RSA quota will be used to fund research activities and compensate vessels that participate in research activities and/or harvest set-aside quota. Projects funded under the Scallop RSA Program must enhance the knowledge of the scallop fishery resource or contribute to the body of information on which scallop management decisions are made. Priority will be given to scallop research proposals that investigate research priorities identified by the Council, which are detailed under the Program Priorities section of this announcement.",

This ROSES NRA covers all aspects of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences, including, but not limited to: theory, modeling, and analysis of SMD science data; aircraft, stratospheric balloon, suborbital rocket, and commercial reusable rocket investigations; development of experiment techniques suitable for future SMD space missions; development of concepts for future SMD space missions; development of advanced technologies relevant to SMD missions; development of techniques for and the laboratory analysis of both extraterrestrial samples returned by spacecraft, as well as terrestrial samples that support or otherwise help verify observations from SMD Earth system science missions; determination of atomic and composition parameters needed to analyze space data, as well as returned samples from the Earth or space; Earth surface observations and field campaigns that support SMD science missions; development of integrated Earth system models; development of systems for applying Earth science research data to societal needs; and development of applied information systems applicable to SMD objectives and data. Awards range from under $100K per year for focused, limited efforts (e.g., data analysis) to more than $1M per year for extensive activities (e.g., development of science experiment hardware). The funds available for awards in each program element offered in this ROSES NRA range from less than one to several million dollars, which allow selection from a few to as many as several dozen proposals depending on the program objectives and the submission of proposals of merit. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intra-agency transfers depending on the nature of the proposing organization and/or program requirements. The typical period of performance for an award is four years, although a few programs may specify shorter or longer (maximum of five years) periods. Organizations of every type, domestic and foreign, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, may submit proposals without restriction on number or teaming arrangements. Note that it is NASA policy that all investigations involving non-U.S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds. Proposal due dates are scheduled starting on April 29, 2011, and continue through April 30, 2012. Electronically submitted Notices of Intent to propose are requested for most program elements, with the first such due date being March 18, 2011. Electronic submission of proposals is required by the respective due dates for each program element and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Electronic proposals may be submitted via the NASA proposal data system NSPIRES or via Grants.gov. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this ROSES NRA must be registered with NSPIRES; organizations that intend to submit proposals via Grants.gov must be registered with Grants.gov in addition to being registered with NSPIRES. Such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. All principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators) must be registered in NSPIRES regardless of submission system. Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Details of the solicited programs are given in the Appendices of this ROSES NRA. Proposal due dates are given in Tables 2 and 3 of this ROSES NRA. Interested proposers should monitor http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ or subscribe to the electronic notification system there for additional new programs or amendments to this ROSES NRA through February 2012, at which time release of a subsequent ROSES NRA is planned. A web archive (and RSS feed) for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to this ROSES NRA can be found at: http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2011/.

Planning grant activities for behavioral and social interventions may include pilot testing of the intervention during the R34 phase, thus a separate FOA (PAR-14-342) will support these types of interventional trials.",

          "Description": "Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from and depend upon the synergy of computational and physical components. Emerging CPS will be coordinated, distributed, and connected, and must be robust and responsive. The CPS of tomorrow will need to far exceed the systems of today in capability, adaptability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability. Examples of the many CPS application areas include the smart electric grid, smart transportation, smart buildings, smart medical technologies, next-generation air traffic management, and advanced manufacturing. CPS will transform the way people interact with engineered systems, just as the Internet transformed the way people interact with information. However, these goals cannot be achieved without rigorous systems engineering.The December 2010 report of the President&amp;apos;s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, Designing a Digital Future: Federally Funded Research and Development in Networking and Information Technology calls for continued investment in CPS research because of its scientific and technological importance as well as its potential impact on grand challenges in a number of sectors critical to U.S. security and competitiveness, including aerospace, automotive, chemical production, civil infrastructure, energy, healthcare, manufacturing, materials and transportation.We do not yet have a mature science to support systems engineering of high confidence CPS, and the consequences are profound. Traditional analysis tools are unable to cope with the full complexity of CPS or adequately predict system behavior. The present electric power grid, an ad hoc system, experiences blackouts over large regions, tripped by minor events that escalate with surprising speed into widespread power failures. This illustrates the limitations of the current science and technology, which do not enable us to conceptualize and design for the deep interdependencies among engineered systems and the natural world. At the same time, pressure to develop technologies such as renewable energy, wireless health, advanced manufacturing, smart materials, and electrified ground and air vehicles creates an unprecedented opportunity to rethink many important classes of systems.The goal of the CPS program is to develop the core system science needed to engineer complex cyber-physical systems upon which people can depend with high confidence. The program aims to foster a research community committed to advancing research and education in CPS and to transitioning CPS science and technology into engineering practice. By abstracting from the particulars of specific systems and application domains, the CPS program aims to reveal cross-cutting fundamental scientific and engineering principles that underpin the integration of cyber and physical elements across all application sectors. To expedite and accelerate the realization of cyber-physical systems in a wide range of applications, the CPS program also supports the development of methods, tools, and hardware and software components based upon these cross-cutting principles, along with validation of the principles via prototypes and test beds.Three types of research and education projects will be considered, which differ in scope and goals:Breakthrough projects must offer a significant advance in fundamental CPS science, engineering and/or technology that has the potential to change the field. Funding for Breakthrough projects may be requested for a total of up to $750,000 for a period of up to 3 years.Synergy projects must demonstrate innovation at the intersection of multiple disciplines, to accomplish a clear goal that requires an integrated perspective spanning the disciplines. Funding for Synergy projects may be requested for a total of $750,001 to $2,000,000 for a period of 3 to 4 years.Frontiers projects must address clearly identified critical CPS challenges that cannot be achieved by a set of smaller projects. Funding may be requested for a total of $1,200,000 to $10,000,000 for a period of 4 to 5 years. Note that, due to the difference in goals and scope, the range for Frontiers projects overlaps with the range for Synergy projects.The CPS program is cooperating with other government agencies to support cyber-physical systems research that is relevant to their missions. Dear Colleague Letters will announce these opportunities as they arise.A more complete description of the CPS program is provided in Section II, Program Description, of this solicitation.",

Using endpoints originally established for clinical efficacy with oseltamivir has forced manufacturers to engage outpatient locations for enrollment of individuals with influenza-like-illness in large numbers, with very few individuals having complicated influenza that would benefit from antiviral treatment. The PHEMCE coordination has the goal to improve enrollment of high risk individuals such as those who present to the JHU Emergency Department, are identified as influenza virus positive by advanced rapid diagnostic testing, many of which are subsequently hospitalized. These patients can be treated early; thus providing a target population that can be more effectively monitored for clinical response to treatment.",

This is in accordance with World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.  KNBTS was established in the year 2000 with the goal of ensuring a safe and sufficient blood supply for the country. Previously, blood was obtained from non-voluntary family replacement donors at fragmented hospital-based transfusion units that lacked a standardization of procedures. The policy guidelines on blood transfusion (2001) recommended a shift from hospital based transfusion services to a centralized system.  This ensures standardization and improved quality of blood supplies with consequent reduction in transmission of HIV, hepatitis and other transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs).         Previous cooperative agreements include U62/CCU023686 of 2004 and U2GPS001794 of 2010. The proposed new project will build on the previous two cooperative agreements between KNBTS and CDC for HIV prevention through blood transfusion.  The previous 2 cooperative agreements were single eligibility because KNBTS is the sole body with mandate to oversee Kenya blood services, and the two single eligibility requests were successful. Applications may be submitted by Ministries of Health (MOH), National Blood Transfusion Services, or their bona fide agents. Bona Fide Agent/s must provide a support letter from MOH.",

It is also to provide transit resources for rural communities in the State of Montana who do not have access to these resources. The public purpose of this cooperative agreement is to provide a free transit system over the Going-to-the-Sun Road to the visiting public. Its purpose accomplishes not only what the Final EIS/ROD required by law but also a small reduction in vehicular traffic on the Road during construction. Glacier National Park will have direct budgetary oversight and quality control/quality assurance controls of the entire transit operation Without this substantial involvement it would be very easy to overspend and cause a reduction in transit service to the visitors of Glacier National Park. It is also necessary to keep the policies and values of Glacier National Park as the overarching and guiding principles for the cooperating partner. SINGLE-SOURCE JUSTIFICATION DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR SINGLE SOURCE POLICY REQUIREMENTS Department of the Interior Policy (505 DM 2) requires a written justification which explains why competition is not practicable for each single-source award. The justification must address one or more of the following criteria as well as discussion of the program legislative history, unique capabilities of the proposed recipient, and cost-sharing contribution offered by the proposed recipient, as applicable. In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria: (1) Unsolicited Proposal &amp;#150; The proposed award is the result of an unsolicited assistance application which represents a unique or innovative idea, method, or approach which is not the subject of a current or planned contract or assistance award, but which is deemed advantageous to the program objectives; (2) Continuation &amp;#150; The activity to be funded is necessary to the satisfactory completion of, or is a continuation of an activity presently being funded, and for which competition would have a significant adverse effect on the continuity or completion of the activity; (3) Legislative intent &amp;#150; The language in the applicable authorizing legislation or legislative history clearly indicates Congress&amp;#146; intent to restrict the award to a particular recipient of purpose; (4) Unique Qualifications &amp;#150; The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon a variety of demonstrable factors such as location, property ownership, voluntary support capacity, cost-sharing ability if applicable, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications; (5) Emergencies &amp;#150; Program/award where there is insufficient time available (due to a compelling and unusual urgency, or substantial danger to health or safety) for adequate competitive procedures to be followed. The National Park Service awarded this task to Flathead County, Eagle Transit based on the following exception. (4) Unique Qualifications &amp;#150; A. Background: The National Park Service (NPS) is currently underway with the major rehabilitation of the Going-to-the-Sun Road (GTSR) in Glacier National Park. Rehabilitation, led by the Western Federal Lands Highway Division (WFLHD) Federal Highway Administration, will be ongoing for the duration of this Agreement based on current funding levels. A Congressionally mandated Citizens Advisory Committee, the Final Environmental Impact Statement (FEIS) and Record of Decision (ROD) for the project all mandated that the NPS be charged with the responsibility of mitigating construction impacts to the visitor experience and the corresponding impact to local communities during the construction period. The Final Environmental Impact Study and Record of Decision (FEIS/ROD) solution was instituting a Transit system augmented by an Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and other visitor services to ensure mitigation goals are met during the construction period: 1. During peak season, visitors will encounter no more than 30 to 40 minutes of cumulative delays driving the GTSR; and 2. Park visitation levels will remain at a minimum of 94% of average visitation. The project implementation included a shuttle system free to all boarding passengers operating on both sides of the Continental Divide on the GTSR, constructing the new Transit Center near Apgar Village on the west side, upgrading the St. Mary Visitor Center to incorporate Transit operations on the east side, building the commensurate transit stops along the proposed routes and implementing the ITS system focused on transit management. Glacier National Park, the Montana Department of Transportation, and Flathead County, continue to stand behind the completion of the GTSR rehabilitation project as early as possible with minimal negative impacts to visitors. The State and County have a vested interest in maintaining and promoting visitation to Glacier National Park, which is one of the goals outlined in the mitigation plan. In addition to being geared toward providing visitors an opportunity for a favorable experience, there are significant economic benefits in the County and throughout the State directly related to park visitation. The State, in cooperation with Flathead County, is willing to continue the partnership with the park toward the goal of increasing the availability of public transportation in and around the park. The County has identified a need for additional vehicles to serve the rapidly growing public transportation requirements. State funding provides an unprecedented opportunity to expand the transportation system beyond park boundaries. Flathead County has the experience and expertise in public transportation as demonstrated by having operated Eagle Transit, a local service provider, for the past 25 years. Eagle Transit has the continued capability to operate the park&amp;#146;s transit system with the flexibility necessary to accommodate changing park requirements.",

          "Description": "The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) is issuing, on behalf of the Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO), a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) DE-FOA-0001162, entitled ?Targeted Algal Biofuels and Bioproducts (TABB)?. The TABB FOA seeks alternative pathways to overcome two of the key barriers to commercializing algal biofuels: the high cost of producing algal biomass and the low yield of target biofuel and bioproduct feedstocks produced from algae. Specifically, the TABB FOA will support: 1) the development of algae cultures that produce valuable bioproducts alongside fuels to increase the overall value of the biomass; and 2) the development of crop protection and CO2 utilization technologies to boost culture productivity and yield to reduce the cost of the biomass. The goal is to enable a modeled minimum fuel selling price, assuming mature technologies, of less than $5 gasoline gallon equivalent for algal biofuels through creation of valuable products alongside fuels and achieving increased biomass productivity that leads to higher feedstock yields. The TABB FOA includes two topic areas: 1. Consortia that bring together upstream and downstream expertise to develop biofuels and bioproducts from algae that are comparable and competitive with their petroleum-based counterparts and have broad national market impacts; 2. Single investigator or small team technology development projects focused on developing crop protection or CO2 utilization technologies to raise the biomass productivity and demonstrate that the increase could lead to higher yields. Consortia projects in Topic Area 1 will develop and characterize finished products and fuels spanning the entire algae processing system (cultivation, harvesting, processing, refining/bioproduct production). The projects in Topic Area 2 will increase algal biomass productivity and/or yield via crop protection or CO2 utilization strategies. The eXCHANGE system is currently designed to enforce hard deadlines for Concept Paper and Full Application submissions. The APPLY and SUBMIT buttons automatically disable at the defined submission deadlines. The intention of this design is to consistently enforce a standard deadline for all applicants. Applicants that experience issues with submissions PRIOR to the FOA Deadline: In the event that an Applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission, the Applicant should contact the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (exchangehelp@hq.doe.gov). The eXCHANGE helpdesk &amp;amp;/or the EERE eXCHANGE System Administrators (eXCHANGE@go.doe.gov) will assist the Applicant in resolving all issues. Applicants that experience issues with submissions that result in a late submission: In the event that an Applicant experiences technical difficulties with a submission that results in a late submission, the Applicant should contact the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance (exchangehelp@hq.doe.gov). The eXCHANGE helpdesk &amp;amp;/or the EERE eXCHANGE System Administrators (eXCHANGE@go.doe.gov) will assist the Applicant in resolving all issues (including finalizing the submission on behalf of and with the Applicant?s concurrence). DOE will only accept late applications when the Applicant has a) encountered technical difficulties beyond their control; b) has contacted the eXCHANGE helpdesk for assistance, and c) has submitted the application through eXCHANGE within 24 hours of the FOA?s posted deadline. The TABB FOA Informational Webinar will be held on Wednesday, October 8, 2014 from 1:00pm-3:00pm EST. Standard application questions regarding the EERE Office and FOA procedures will be discussed.

The intent of this solicitation is to encourage studies that take an integrative approach towards addressing problems in benign urology. Because lower urinary tract symptoms, such as frequency, urgency, dysuria, terminal dribbling etc., are descriptive, it has been difficult to attribute these symptoms to specific etiologies or to particular urinary tract organs and tissues, supporting structures, or to the peripheral or central nervous system. Furthermore, the lack of fundamental information about lower urinary tract development and physiology has hampered the ability to develop strategies to address lower urinary tract symptoms. These planning centers are to foster programs that undertake a broad approach towards research in benign urology that can integrate investigations of organ-specific development and genetics, structure and function, and physiology and pathophysiology with in vivo studies to understand the potential interplay of urologic and non-urologic organs and tissues. The research teams are expected to be built from established investigators from the basic science and urology and other disciplines. Each IR-BU Center (P20) is limited to a single Scientific Project and must contain an Administrative Core and an Educational Enrichment Program.",

The Neuroscience Blueprint is a collaborative framework through which 16 NIH Institutes, Centers and Offices jointly support neuroscience-related research, with the aim of accelerating discoveries and reducing the burden of nervous system disorders (for further information, see http://neuroscienceblueprint.nih.gov/). The goal of this FOA is to encourage research grant applications that propose to develop or substantially modify existing cutting edge technologies that will advance glial cell research, discovery-based research on glial cell diversity, development and/or function in the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. The primary objective of this FOA is to remove barriers to glial cell research that are due to the scarcity of tools, methods and technologies to target and identify glial cells in a rigorous manner. Applications should aim to transform the field of glial cell research by generating tools that will be widely used throughout the neuroscience community. Research supported by this initiative will (i) provide new tools for manipulating and identifying glial cells based on their heterogeneity, developmental stage or functional state; and /or (ii) tools to allow investigation of glial function and processes, thus contributing to our understanding of normal and abnormal neural function.",

NNH12ZUA001N, entitled NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts: Phase I Studies, will be available as of January 9, 2012 by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ and then linking through the menu listings &amp;#147;Solicitations&amp;#148; to &amp;#147;Open Solicitations.&amp;#148; This solicitation represents a second year of the NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts (NIAC) program, which issued its first solicitation on March 1, 2011, and awarded 30 Phase I studies. These are currently underway. More information is available at: http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oct/early_stage_innovation/niac/ . This NRA will solicit multiple studies, each of which will investigate an architecture, mission, or system concept that has the potential to change the possible in space or aeronautics. NIAC is part of the Space Technology Program in the Office of Chief Technologist (OCT). Aerospace architecture, mission, or system concepts proposed for NIAC Phase I studies must be exciting, unexplored, far-term, and technically credible. Proposals for narrow technology or subsystem development, or incremental or near-term advancement, are explicitly out of scope for this program. Finally, while NIAC encourages great leaps and accepts the accompanying risk, proposals must be technically credible, based on sound scientific principles. The 2012 NIAC Phase I solicitation will be a two step process. Step A will be a 2-page white paper. Proposals shall be submitted electronically, and all Step A proposers shall use the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES), accessible at http://nspires.nasaprs.com , or for Step A may also use Grants.gov. Step B full proposals will be eligible only if invited after review of a Step A submission. Step B proposals shall be submitted electronically through NSPIRES only. This solicitation will be an open announcement; anyone is welcome to respond. Affiliation with any educational institution, commercial or not-for-profit organization, research laboratory, government agency, or NASA Center (including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) is permitted. Individuals may submit, as long as they meet the registration requirements for NSPIRES. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. Each electronic proposal system places requirements on the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the electronic proposal system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Specific propo sal submission deadline dates, evaluation criteria, and submission information will be identified in the NRA. Step A White Papers will be due on or before February 9, 2012; Step B full Proposals will be due on or before April 16, 2012. Comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to NIAC Program representatives at hq-niac@mail.nasa.gov. Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and also included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document located on the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.",

Excellent art is an essential part of building a strong community, as important as land-use, transportation, education, housing, infrastructure, and public safety. Artists and community development practitioners across our nation --sometimes one and the same, sometimes working together -- are striving to make places more livable with enhanced quality of life, increased creative activity, a distinct sense of place, and vibrant local economies that together capitalize on their existing assets. The NEA defines these efforts as Creative Placemaking.Through Our Town, subject to the availability of funding, the National Endowment for the Arts will provide a limited number of grants for creative placemaking projects that contribute towards the livability of communities and help transform them into lively, beautiful, and resilient places with the arts at their core. Our Town prioritizes partnerships between arts organizations and government, private, and nonprofit organizations to achieve livability goals for communities.Our Town offers support for projects in two areas:&amp;#149; Arts Engagement, Cultural Planning, and Design Projects that represent the distinct character and quality of their communities&amp;#149; Projects that Build Knowledge About Creative Placemaking",

Since the Cuyahoga Valley Environmental Education Center opened its doors in 1994, the Conservancy has expertly managed the operations of CVEEC in partnership with the NPS.  In addition, the Conservancy raises funds each year so that children in urban schools in Cleveland and Akron, who otherwise could not afford to experience a residential environmental education program in a national park, have the opportunity to do so.  The remainder of the 2011-2012 school year is already booked to capacity.  The Conservancy has been instrumental in working with the park for the past 23 years to implement numerous interpretive and educational programs for children and adults, create unique special events, and enable the development a very successful Environmental Education Program.      In addition, the Conservancy has two full-time staff who work collaboratively with the park&amp;#146;s Volunteer Program Manager.  This team of three has grown the park&amp;#146;s Volunteer Program over the past two years by over 50% (to over 5,700 volunteers) and has developed a variety of new and creative opportunities for volunteers, allowing them to get involved and become park stewards/ambassadors.   and 1)  The Conservancy is a local non-profit organization based in the Cuyahoga Valley and has strong ties and long-standing, trusted relationships with the surrounding communities in the park.  2)  The Conservancy owns Trail Mix, a small store located adjacent to the Towpath Trail, but outside of park boundaries.  This store serves as a hub for park visitors to gather and as central location for park visitors to obtain information about the park and its programs.  3)  The Conservancy also owns all of the furniture and appliances at the Stanford House, which is utilized mainly for Environmental Education programming purposes.  4)  The existing volunteer base of 5,700+ people assist the organization with everything from hosting special events; to leading public programs in the areas of education, cultural arts, and nature; and removing invasive species, to name a few.  These volunteers also include the Board of Trustees made up of 30 dedicated community leaders from the Cleveland and Akron areas.  5)  The Conservancy actively fund-raises (approximately 50% of its operating budget) to help support its operation and programs.  The Conservancy&amp;#146;s reputation and skilled staff have also enabled the organization to bring additional support to the park through various in-kind donations of equipment and skilled, technical labor.  6)  The Conservancy&amp;#146;s staff brings a high level of educational, arts, marketing, and customer service expertise that the NPS alone could not provide.",

As real-time, accurate and actionable intelligence products are demanded by analysts, warfighters, and decision makers, linear, human-intensive processes are no longer sufficient. The capabilities of current and future adversaries and the dynamism and complexity of the environments in which they operate necessitate vast improvements in the timeliness and execution of intelligence-cycle processes.Humans do not have the cognitive ability or the time to analyze the vast quantities of multi-source, multi-dimensional data that are now available. Revolutionary decision support, situational awareness, sensemaking, inferencing, reasoning, and visualization capabilities must be employed to expediently unlock the information contained in these myriad streams of data.CMIS envisions a future where cognitive technologies can anticipate strategic and tactical information needs, perceptively orchestrate distributed sensors across every domain (cyber, human, terrestrial, air, sea, space, etc.), and deliver timely and accurate recommendations to kinetic and/or non-kinetic agents (human and/or machine) to employ required actions.The transformative technologies of interest are:&amp;#149; Understanding targets as systems&amp;#149; Orchestrated resource management&amp;#149; Cognitive sensemaking&amp;#149; Human-computer symbiosis",

          "Description": "The Department of the Interior, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Office of Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council, administers the Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Program (Catalog of Federal and Domestic Assistance Number 15.643). For many years representatives of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the Alaska Native Community worked together to amend the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty with Canada, and the 1936 Migratory Bird Treaty with Mexico, to allow legal spring subsistence harvest of migratory birds in Alaska. The U.S. Senate ratified the Protocols to the two bilateral migratory bird treaties on October 23, 1997, paving the way for a regulatory process to ensure proper implementation of these amendments. The Protocol with Canada mandates that subsistence users will have an effective and meaningful role in the development of regulations through regional management bodies. The Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council was established in March 2000, with representatives of the Alaska Native Community, Federal Government, and State of Alaska as equals to develop recommendations for, among other things: seasons and bag limits; law enforcement policies; population and harvest monitoring; education programs; research and use of traditional knowledge; and habitat protection. Coordination with Alaska Native regional partner organizations was established to organize subsistence user participation within each region. 50 CFR 92.11(a), states that &amp;#191;we are working with the Alaska Native non-profit groups and local governments&amp;#191;&amp;#191; Under 50 CFR 92.4, Partner 50 CFR 92.11 (b), states that the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service will establish partner agreements with at least one partner organization in each of the listed regions. Organizations or Regional Partners are defined as a regional or local organization or a local tribal government that has entered into a formal agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for the purpose of coordinating the regional programs necessary to involve subsistence users in the regulatory process. Region-specific, formal working agreements have been established with ten Alaska Native non-profit groups and one local government to accomplish the mission of the Migratory Bird Treaty Amendment Protocols. These specific regional organizations were designated as partner organizations following an extensive public involvement process. A list of partner organizations was published in the Federal Register, 65 FR 16405 (March 28, 2000), and amended in 71 FR 35690 (June 21, 2006). Proposals are required to be submitted under this annual announcement in order to be awarded funds. Request for Proposals are required to renew grant agreements that are directed specifically to those regional partners who have already entered into a pre-requisite formal agreement with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. The purpose of each of these grant agreements is to defray each Alaska Native regional partner&amp;#191;s travel and communication expenses enabling them to participate in the co-management process. These grant agreements are not open to competition outside of existing Alaska Native regional partner organizations serving on the Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council. Proposals are to be submitted to the Office of Alaska Migratory Bird Co-Management Council or directly through http://www.grants.gov no later than January 16, 2012, 5:00 PM Alaska time. Proposed requests for funding will be for one-year duration (Fiscal Year 2012).",

ABSTRACT Funding Announcement: Project Title: Hazardous Materials Recipient: Southeast Alaska Guidance Association Principle Investigator: Scott Young Total Anticipated Award Amount: $12,500 Cost Share: N/A New Award Or Continuation: New Anticipated Length of Agreement: Less than 1 year Anticipated Period of Performance: December 30,2011 &amp;#150; September 30, 2012 Award Instrument: Cooperative Agreement Statutory Authority: Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997, Public Law 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009 (181,189), 16 U.S.C 1g; Public Lands Corps Healthy Forests Restoration Act of 2005, Public Law 109-154, 119 Stat. 2891, 2893, 16 U.S.C 1701-1706, 1723; Omnibus Parks and Public Lands Management Act of 1996, Public Law 104-333, 16 U.S.C 1f. CFDA 15.931, Conservation Activities by Youth Service Organizations. Project: 1. Coordinate a work schedule with NPS and provide an eight (8) member crew to include two (2) leaders experienced in the operation of hand tools and small power tools for the following Hazardous Fuel Reduction project: Wrangell-St. Elias National Park and Preserve McCarthy Road Corridor Mechanical Fuel Reduction Project. 2. Provide all food, support costs, and labor to accomplish services indicated in this statement of work. 3. Provide transportation to the work site, camp gear and food for all the crew members. 4. Matching requirement of 25% Single Source Justification Criteria Sited: JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SINGLE SOURCE) FOR DISCRETIONARY COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS BACKGROUND: &amp;#149; A brief history of this project. Is this part of an on-going program, agreement, etc&amp;#133;? o This is part of the pre-existing cooperative agreement between SAGA and NPS. The project entails hazardous fuels reduction along the McCarthy road corridor in WRST. NPS or contract fallers will be falling and limbing spruce trees and SAGA crew members will be assisting with piling of vegetation within the project area to provide defensible space for buildings along the McCarthy road corridor. 1) 505 DM 2 Single Source - Only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements. &amp;#149; Identify the source and explain why specifically competition is not practical. o The funding for this project stipulates that a youth service organization will be used to accomplish the work. SAGA, a youth service organization, has a previously established relationship with the NPS, has done work in many units of NPS Alaska, and has an existing signed cooperative agreement. 2) Nature and description of the supplies or services required to meet the agency&amp;#146;s needs: &amp;#149; Description of the item(s) or service(s) and the required delivery schedule. o SAGA will provide an 8-person crew for manual labor. The crew will be composed of 2 crew leaders (21+ years of age) who have USFS chainsaw training, and 6 crew members between the ages of 15-25. Majority of tasks will involve piling downed vegetation into burn piles. They will be available to work 8 10- hour days (eighty hours total) for the duration of time covered in the task agreement. Potential work date range is May 30 - September 21, 2012. &amp;#149; The minimum essential characteristics or unique features of the item(s). If requesting a service, fully describe all services to be performed. o SAGA will be responsible for providing transportation to the work site, personal protective equipment (hard hats, leather gloves, and safety glasses), food for their crewmembers, and camping supplies (tents, pads, sleeping bags). &amp;#149; State the price of the requirement &amp;#150; base year and every additional anticipated agreement period thereafter. o $12,500 for 2012 3) Criteria for justifying award without competition. In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria. Please explain which criterion specifically addresses the proposed agreement. Unique Qualifications - The applicant is uniquely qualified to perform the activity based upon a variety of demonstrable factors such as location, property ownership, voluntary support capacity, cost-sharing ability, if applicable, technical expertise, or other such unique qualifications; SAGA has a proven positive track record when working with the National Park Service &amp;#150; Alaska Region. Because they are an Alaska-based organization, they bring specific Alaska knowledge of the varied landscapes, potential hazards, and project logistics to the table. They have shown great flexibility in working with remote Alaska logistics including organizing transportation and equipment. In addition, SAGA is able to provide a single crew for the entirety of the proposed work schedule and thus this saves the NPS time and money from having to hire more than one crew. 4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: Type and degree of market survey conducted I requested cost estimates from SAGA, Inc., and Student Conservation Association, Inc. SAGA was the only one that responded able to provide a crew with their own tools and equipment. 5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: None",

Individually, each health center plays an important role in the goal of ensuring access to services, and combined, they have had a critical impact on the health care status of medically underserved and vulnerable populations throughout the United States and its territories. The Health Center Program targets the Nation&amp;#191;s neediest populations and geographic areas by currently funding approximately 1,300 health centers that operate over 9,000 service delivery sites in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin. In 2013, more than 21 million patients, including medically underserved and uninsured patients, received comprehensive, culturally competent, quality primary health care services through the Health Center Program. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits applications for the Health Center Program&amp;#191;s Service Area Competition &amp;#191; Additional Area (SAC-AA). The FOA details the SAC-AA eligibility requirements, review criteria, and awarding factors for organizations seeking a grant for operational support of an announced service area under the Health Center Program, including Community Health Center (CHC &amp;#191; section 330(e)), Migrant Health Center (MHC &amp;#191; section 330(g)), Health Care for the Homeless (HCH &amp;#191; section 330(h)), and/or Public Housing Primary Care (PHPC &amp;#191; section 330(i)). For the purposes of this document, the term &amp;#191;health center&amp;#191; refers to the diverse types of health centers (i.e., CHC, MHC, HCH, and /or PHPC) supported under section 330 of the PHS Act, as amended.",

The purpose of this FOA is to support the AfSBT, the only African standards and accrediting body, to develop, expand, and implement its Africa-wide accreditation program, and to build the organization&amp;apos;s capacity to deliver other training and quality management services to member countries in Africa.  AfSBT is the only organization globally that has been approved by Africa member states to operate an accreditation system specifically for African blood transfusion services.  No other organization maintains Africa-specific standards for blood transfusion services or offers training, pre-accreditation assessments, and formal accreditation assessments based on those standards.     African countries currently rely on US or European based accreditation services to validate their domestic quality management systems.  However, these non-Africa-based services are typically designed for blood services in industrialized, high-income, countries.  As such, African blood services, especially those in resource-limited settings, face substantial challenges in obtaining accreditation.     During the last decade, AfSBT has benefited from substantial volunteer contributions from technical experts in several African countries, and counts most countries in the WHO AFRO region (as well as several countries in the WHO EMRO region) as dues-paying members.  But a volunteer-based Secretariat has proved unsustainable and inefficient.  As the only standards-based organization supporting blood services in Africa, AfSBT is uniquely positioned to benefit from CDC and PEPFAR support to strengthen indigenous capacity to provide accreditation to its members.     CDC&amp;apos;s Division of Global HIV/AIDS, the primary implementing agency for PEPFAR&amp;apos;s blood safety initiative, recognizes AfSBT as a powerful example of the kind of indigenous technical organization PEPFAR seeks to support as part of its long-term transition and sustainability strategies.  In addition, accreditation is a core objective of the PEPFAR quality strategy.     Unlike North America, Europe, and other developed regions of the world, the African continent lacks a diversity of capacity and organizations capable of implementing the standards-based accreditation project proposed by AfSBT.  Indeed, AfSBT is the only organization of its kind in Africa dedicated to a regional approach to quality and blood service accreditation.      AfSBT also has a history of collaboration with CDC via work by several CDC partner governments to attain AfSBT accreditation.  The FOA associated with this SEJ seeks to expand on that collaboration to build a sustainable organizational structure from which AfSBT may continue to offer its Africa-specific accreditation services to partner countries.

SMART objectives related to this project include: &amp;#149; Specific: AfSBT will develop and implement an Africa-wide accreditation system for African blood transfusion services. &amp;#149; Measurable: An increasing number of African blood transfusion services will attain AfSBT accreditation through the three step process. &amp;#149; Appropriate: AfSBT&amp;#146;s step-wise accreditation system will be based on internationally accepted standards, but tailored to operational environments in low-resource African countries. &amp;#149; Realistic: AfSBT is a 10 year old organization with a strong cadre of volunteer technical experts. This project seeks to leverage that volunteer-based experience and expertise to strengthen AfSBT&amp;#146;s Secretariat into a sustainable permanent organization. &amp;#149; Time-bound: The above objectives can realistically be achieved during the five year project period. These activities will also contribute to CDC&amp;#146;s and PEPFAR&amp;#146;s strategic objective to transition bi-lateral activities to local organizations and a diverse, sustainable and, where possible, largely local, source of long-term funding.

Although current neutron source intensities are adequate for rapid, high resolution imaging, the large infrastructure required to achieve these intensities limits their applications. Achieving these neutron intensities in an expeditionary package will enable concepts-of-operations (CONOPS) that are currently infeasible due to SWaP constraints. While source intensity is only one aspect of the performance of a complete neutron analytical capability, achieving orders-of-magnitude improvements in portable neutron source intensities remains critical for widespread neutron imaging and analysis. It is envisioned that these significant advances in neutron output versus system SWaP will be transformative for specialized portable neutron sensing CONOPS in addition to portable neutron radiography.",

          "Description": "The Climate Change Education Partnership (CCEP) program seeks to establish a coordinated national network of regionally- or thematically-based partnerships devoted to increasing the adoption of effective, high quality educational programs and resources related to the science of climate change and its impacts. Each CCEP is required to be of a large enough scale that it will have catalytic or transformative impact that cannot be achieved through other core NSF program awards. The CCEP program is one facet of a larger NSF collection of awards related to Climate Change Education (CCE) that has two goals: (1) preparing a new generation of climate scientists, engineers, and technicians equipped to provide innovative and creative approaches to understanding global climate change and to mitigate its impact; and, (2) preparing today&amp;apos;s U.S. citizens to understand global climate change and its implications in ways that can lead to informed, evidence-based responses and solutions. Each CCEP is required to include substantial involvement of representatives from each of the following communities: climate scientists; experts in the learning sciences; and, practitioners from within formal or informal education venues. This combined expertise is intended to foster innovative, trans-disciplinary advances in climate change education and insure that educational programs and resources developed by each CCEP reflect current understanding about climate science, the best theoretical approaches for teaching and learning such a complex topic, and the practical means necessary to reach the intended learner audience(s). Additional types of expertise are allowed, but these three required areas must form the core partnership. Each CCEP should be organized around either geographic regions that share similar climate change impacts, or major climate impact themes (e.g., sea-level rise).The CCEP program is a two-phase program. CCEP Phase I (CCEP-I) projects funded in FY 2010 and FY 2011 and a sub-set of CCE projects funded in FY 2009 have focused on Partnership initiation and strategic planning for Phase II. Objectives for Phase I activities included: (1) conducting an inventory of existing climate change education resources and identifying educational needs and opportunities relevant to their particular region or theme; (2) identifying key players from relevant stakeholder communities and initiating network development; (3) convening community workshops and other community-building activities that lead toward development of a comprehensive climate change education strategic plan for that Partnership; and, (4) laying the groundwork to develop, customize, and scale-up standards-based instructional materials, professional development and training models, and other appropriate activities tailored to the Partnership&amp;apos;s goals. The current solicitation seeks proposals for Phase II Partnerships (CCEP-II) only. CCEP-II awardees will receive up to 5 years of funding to support full-scale implementation of mature and robust strategic plans already developed by regional or thematic partnerships to improve climate change education activities at a significant scale and meet the goals of the CCE program. Strategic plans must include well-integrated formative and summative evaluation activities conducted by an external evaluator. Prior CCEP-I funding is not an eligibility requirement, but all proposed Phase II Partnerships that did not have CCEP-I funding must demonstrate that they meet the required criteria and have undertaken activities that address the goals and objectives described in the CCEP-I program solicitation.",

          "Description": "The consequences of climate variability and change are becoming more immediate and profound than previously anticipated. Important impacts have highlighted that climate variability and change can have significant effects on decadal and shorter time scales, with significant consequences for plant, animal, human, and physical systems. Such aspects include the onset of prolonged droughts on several continents, increased frequency of floods, loss of agricultural and forest productivity, degraded ocean and permafrost ecosystems, global sea level rise and the rapid retreat of ice sheets and glaciers, loss of Arctic sea ice, and changes in ocean currents. The EaSM funding opportunity enables interagency cooperation on one of the most pressing problems of the millennium: climate change, how it is likely to affect our world, and how we can plan for its consequences. It allows the partner agencies -- National Science Foundation (NSF), U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), and U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) -- to combine resources to identify and fund the most meritorious and highest-impact projects that support their respective missions, while eliminating duplication of effort and fostering collaboration between agencies and the investigators they support.This interdisciplinary scientific challenge calls for the development and application of next-generation Earth System Models that include coupled and interactive representations of such things as ocean and atmospheric currents, human activities, agricultural working lands and forests, urban environments, biogeochemistry, atmospheric chemistry, the water cycle and land ice. This solicitation seeks to attract scientists from the disciplines of geosciences, social sciences, agricultural and biological sciences, mathematics and statistics, physics, and chemistry. Successful proposals will develop intellectual excitement in the participating disciplinary communities and engage diverse interdisciplinary teams with sufficient breadth to achieve the scientific objectives. We encourage proposals that have strong broader impacts, including public access to data and other research products of general interest, as well as educational, diversity, or societal impacts.The long-term goals of this solicitation are to improve on and extend current Earth System modeling capabilities to: Achieve comprehensive, reliable global and regional predictions of decadal climate variability and change through advanced understanding of the coupled interactive physical, chemical, biological, and human processes that drive the climate system.Quantify the impacts of climate variability and change on natural and human systems, and identify and quantify feedback loops.Maximize the utility of available observational and model data for impact, vulnerability/resilience, and risk assessments through up/downscaling activities and uncertainty characterization.Effectively translate climate predictions and associated uncertainties into the scientific basis for policy and management decisions related to human interventions and adaptation to the projected impacts of climate change.The following are specific areas of interest to the funding agencies for EaSM 2: (i) Research that has the potential to dramatically improve predictive capabilities; (ii) Prediction and attribution studies; (iii) Research that addresses critical issues linking relevant Earth system processes over a variety of spatial and temporal scales; (iv) Research that examines the relationships between climate variability and change to human and natural environments from the human perspective; (v) Development and applications of metrics, methods, and tools for testing and evaluating climate and climate impact predictions and their uncertainty characterization. These subareas of particular interest are described in greater detail below under Program Description: Areas of interest.",

The purpose of this RFI is to obtain information about capabilities and market information from potential applicants regarding an education project in Afghanistan. This RFI is issued for the purpose of &amp;#147;Requesting Comments&amp;#148; to the concept for a new project/activity and seeks information from companies and organizations that have the capacity, proven track record, and interest in the design and implementation of effective early grade reading and access to basic education programs. The information obtained may be used in the design of a future education activity that addresses both early grade reading and access to education. All activities under the proposed project will take place in Afghanistan. USAID is looking for responses that take into consideration the culture, norms and context of Afghanistan. Early Grade Reading and Access to Education Component Description Term: five years (basic education funds) Managing Office: Office of Social Sector Development, Education, Afghanistan Proposed Mechanism: To be determined (Contract or Cooperative Agreement) Geographic Scope: To be determined Link to other USAID Projects: N/A USAID/Afghanistan Mission&amp;#146;s Education program, in alignment with Afghanistan&amp;#146;s National Priority Program Cluster 2 &amp;#150; Education for All, USAID Education Strategy and the USAID/Afghanistan&amp;#146;s Strategy for Transformation, supports measurable, consequential gains in three areas: education systems strengthening, access to education, and quality of reading instruction. The proposed project aims to provide students in grades one and two with evidence-based reading instruction that will ensure that they can read grade level text after two years of school. The activity will draw on 30 years of international research and half a decade of USAID experience in early grade reading to work with the Ministry of Education (MoE) to: 1) offer students technically-sound early grade reading material, 2) train teachers to use that material for instruction in class, 3) provide teachers with high-quality coaching in the implementation of early grade reading instruction, 4) mobilize communities in support of improved access to school and reading instruction, 5) assist the MoE to upgrade its processes for assessing early grade reading achievement, and 6) conduct high-level policy dialogue with the MoE to support procedures and guidelines for schools and teachers which align with best practices in reading instruction and school management. With regards to enhancing access to formal MoE schools and bringing children who dropped out or are &amp;#147;permanently absent&amp;#148; back into school, the integrated early grade reading and access to education activity will focus on applying evidence-based approaches to sustainably increase access to education and will showcase these approaches for eventual scale-up by the MoE. Under this mechanism, efforts to address critical access barriers to education in Afghanistan, especially for girls, include community awareness campaigns, small-scale rehabilitation activities (boundary wall and/or toilets), and school safety measures. USAID/Afghanistan is soliciting comments from companies and organizations with relevant development experience that will help the likelihood of success for early grade reading and access to education in Afghanistan. Please consider the following: Ensure comments are concise and specific to information included within the description above. In addition to general comments, please respond the following questions: 1. What efforts have been taken in the past in terms of improving early grade reading in Afghanistan? What were the results and lessons learned from these efforts? 2. What efforts would be needed in terms of creating demand for and increasing access to the formal MoE schools? What can be done to improve student retention? 3. What efforts would be needed to increase the number of girls enrolled and regularly attending school? 4. What efforts would be needed to engage parents and communities in oversight and accountability of education at local and provincial levels? 5. How can USAID engage with other private and public institutions to leverage funds for improved access and quality of education? 6. How can USAID support MoE to sustain and scale up successful early grade reading and access interventions? 7. As activities are being implemented, how can USAID improve capacity at provincial and district levels as well as, communication between central and provincial and local levels? 8. Given the challenges of insecurity and lack of infrastructure, what efforts can be made to effectively monitor and measure impact of interventions? Issuance of this RFI does not constitute a Request for Applications. USAID/Afghanistan intends to issue either a Request for Proposals (RFP) or Request for Applications (RFA) in the near future. This notice does not constitute an obligation or endorsement by USAID to proceed with the Early Grade Reading and Improved Access Project. Responses to this RFI are not binding on the U. S. Government and do not obligate USAID to issue a Solicitation (RFP or RFA), nor does it commit USAID to pay any cost incurred in the preparation and submission of comments. Responses will be treated as information only and will not be used as an application. This RFI can be downloaded from grants.gov. Interested stakeholders who are not able to retrieve the RFI from the Internet can request a copy from kabulaidoaamailbox@usaid.gov. The request for comments will be open from the date of publication of this RFI, through October 5, 2014, 23h59pm, Washington, DC Time (October 6, 2014, 8h29 a.m. Kabul, Afghanistan Time). Comments should be submitted electronically only to: kabulaidoaamailbox@usaid.gov, no later than October 5, 2014, 23h59pm, Washington, DC Time.

          "Description": "To address ecological questions that cannot be resolved with short-term observations or experiments, NSF established the Long Term Ecological Research Program (LTER) in 1980.Three unique components differentiate LTER research from projects supported by other NSF programs: 1) the research is located at specific sites chosen to represent major ecosystem types or natural biomes; 2) it emphasizes the study of phenomena over long periods of time, based upon data collection in five core areas; and 3) projects include significant integrative, cross-site, network-wide research. Research at LTER sites provides experiments, databases, and research programs for use by other scientists. It must test important ecological or ecosystem theories including, but not limited to, ecosystem stability, biodiversity, community structure, and energy flow. Recognizing that the value of long-term data extends beyond use at any individual site, NSF requires that data collected by all LTER sites be made broadly accessible.Since its origin in 1980, the LTER program has grown in size and mandate. It currently supports 26 active sites representing major biotic regions of the continental US and Alaska, the marine environment, and the Antarctic continent. Its disciplinary scope includes population and community ecology, ecosystem science, evolutionary biology, phylogenetic systematics, social and economic sciences, urban ecology, oceanography, mathematics, computer science, and science education. The existence of a network across sites allows for continental-scale questions to be addressed.",

          "Description": "This announcement solicits applications for the fiscal year (FY) 2015 Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program (RWHAP) Part B Base, AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) Base, Pacific Island Jurisdiction Part B/ADAP Base, ADAP Supplemental, Minority AIDS Initiative (MAI), and Emerging Communities. The purpose of this grant program is to assist States and Territories in developing and/or enhancing access to a comprehensive continuum of high quality HIV care and treatment for low-income people living with HIV (PLWH). It supports the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) goals of reducing HIV incidence, increasing access to care and optimizing health outcomes, and reducing HIV-related health disparities. A comprehensive continuum of care includes the thirteen (13) core medical services specified in the Public Health Service Act, Section 2612(b)(3) [42 U.S.C. 300ff-21(b)(3)], as amended by the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Treatment Extension Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-87). Comprehensive HIV/AIDS care beyond these core services may include supportive services that meet the criteria of enabling individuals and families living with HIV/AIDS to access and remain in primary medical care to improve their medical outcomes. These core and appropriate support services assist PLWH in accessing treatment for HIV/AIDS infection that is consistent with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Treatment Guidelines. (See http://www.aidsinfo.nih.gov). The Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) HIV/AIDS Bureau (HAB) recognizes that the RWHAP Part B/ADAP grantees must use grant funds to support, develop and expand systems of care to meet the needs of PLWH. HAB requires RWHAP Part B/ADAP Programs to conduct needs assessments and use needs assessment data to make decisions on needed services to eliminate barriers faced by PLWH in accessing and remaining in medical care. Important Notes: &amp;#183; In accordance with the RWHAP legislation (Section 2618(a)(2)(H)(v) of the Public Health Service (PHS) Act) and pending further direction or statutory provisions and/or appropriations language, hold harmless will not be a factor in the FY 2015 RWHAP Part B/ADAP awards. &amp;#183; The Early Identification of Individuals with HIV/AIDS (EIIHA) requirements in this funding announcement have been updated and streamlined. Please review carefully when preparing this section of your application. The following information will assist in understanding and completing this year&amp;#191;s grant application: &amp;#183; RWHAP Part B funds are subject to Section 2612(b)(1) of the PHS Act, which requires that not less than 75 percent of the funds be used to provide core medical services that are needed in the State/Territory for individuals with HIV/AIDS who are identified and eligible under the RWHAP. Core medical services and support services allowed under RWHAP Part B are limited to services that are needed for individuals with HIV/AIDS to achieve their medical outcomes as defined by the RWHAP. The most recent service definitions can be found in the latest version of the National Monitoring Standards. &amp;#183; Applicants seeking a waiver to the core medical services requirement must submit a waiver request either with this grant application, at any time up to the application submission, or up to 4 months after the start of the grant award for FY 2015. Submission should be in accordance with the Federal Register Notice, Vol. 78, No.101, dated Friday, May 24, 2013, and may be found at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2013-05-24/pdf/2013-12354.pdf. The HAB Policy 13-07, Federal Register Notice and Sample Letters can all be found at http://hab.hrsa.gov/manageyourgrant/policiesletters.html. If submitting with the application, a core medical services waiver request should be included as Attachment 10. &amp;#183; Agreements and Compliance Assurances are included (Appendix A) with this funding opportunity announcement (FOA), and require the signature of the Chief Elected Official (CEO), or the CEO&amp;#191;s designee; this document should be included as Attachment 9.",

This is part of the overall plan to support the development of environmentally and economically sustainable ocean, coastal, or Great Lakes aquaculture. Aquaculture that occurs in the Great Lakes or its coastal zone is considered marine aquaculture for this competition. Priorities for this FY 2012 competition include: Research to inform specific regulatory decisions; Research that supports multi-use spatial planning; and Socio-economic research targeted to understand aquaculture in a larger context. Proposals must be able to express how the proposed work will have a high probability of significantly advancing U.S. marine aquaculture development in the short-term (1-2 years) or medium-term (3-5 years). This Federal Funding Opportunity includes information on application and criteria for aquaculture research projects requesting a total of $50,000 to $500,000 in federal funding for up to a two-year period. Matching funds are required. Given the anticipated amount of funding and the anticipated number and quality of proposals submitted, it is anticipated that at least seven projects will be awarded in FY 2012. Additional proposals from this competition may be selected for funding in the next fiscal year, subject to the availability of funds. Ideally, awards are anticipated to start no later than September 1, 2012.",

          "Description": "The United States Government, represented by the United States Agency for International Development in Zimbabwe (USAID/Zimbabwe), intends to award a cooperative agreement for the Poverty Reduction and Food Security-Crop Development (PRFS-CD) program. The project will be performed in Zimbabwe and the period of performance will be five (5) years from the date of award. USAID/Zimbabwe intends to limit competition to local Zimbabwean organizations. A total of $8 million is available for this cooperative agreement, and only one cooperative agreement will be awarded.USAID/Zimbabwe&amp;#146;s new Poverty Reduction and Food Security Program (PRFS) aims to: (1) reduce rural poverty and increase incomes and food security of targeted smallholder agricultural producers through increased agricultural production and productivity, and market linkages; (2) improve the hygiene and nutrition practices leading to improved nutritional status of beneficiary households; and (3) build the capacity of local organizations to implement agricultural development activities funded by USAID. The overall PRFS program targets assistance to four sub-sectors: high value crops, staple food crops, beef cattle, and dairy cattle. The cooperative agreement contemplated by this anticipated request for applications will focus on high value crops and staple food crops components. A separate Request for Proposals is anticipated for the beef and dairy cattle components, with a capacity building component as well. Innovative approaches are encouraged. The attached Draft Program Description is provided for more information. Applicants are encouraged to submit comments at this time. Please submit all comments (if any) to Leona Sasinkova at lsasinkova@usaid.gov by October 7, 2014.

NMFS will consider internationally-based projects targeting sea turtle populations that originate from the Western and Central Pacific Ocean (i.e., from areas outside U.S. jurisdiction) but which migrate through or forage within the PIR and are impacted by PIR activities managed by NMFS, as well as projects that are otherwise relevant to NMFS management and recovery obligations. The PIR is comprised of the exclusive economic zones (EEZs) adjacent to the State of Hawaii, U.S. territories of American Samoa, Guam, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI), and the U.S. Pacific Remote Island Areas (PRIAs) of Jarvis, Johnston, Wake, Howland and Baker Islands, Kingman Reef, and Palmyra and Midway Atolls. Sea turtle species with documented linkages to the PIR include: leatherback (Dermochelys coriacea), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), North and South Pacific loggerhead (Caretta caretta) Distinct Population Segments, green (Chelonia mydas), and olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea).",

The program will fund P50 SPORE grants to support state-of-the-art investigator-initiated translational research that will contribute to improved prevention, early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of an organ-specific cancer (or a related group of cancers). For the purpose of this funding announcement, cancers derived from the same organ system (i.e., group of organs that perform common function) are considered related. Examples of such organ systems include gastro-intestinal, endocrine, circulatory, and other biological systems. Other programmatically appropriate groups of cancers may include those centered around a common biological mechanism critical for promoting tumorigenesis and/or cancer progression in organ sites that belong to different organ systems. For example, a SPORE may focus on cancers caused by the same infectious agent, or sustained and promoted by dysregulation of a common signaling pathway. SPOREs are expected not only to conduct a wide spectrum of research activities, but also to contribute significantly to the development of specialized shared resources core facilities, improved research model systems, and collaborative research projects with other institutions. The research supported through this program must be translational in nature and must always be focused upon knowledge of human biology stemming from research using cellular, molecular, structural, biochemical, and/or genetic experimental approaches with the goal of a translational human endpoint within the project period of the grant. In addition, SPOREs must include both a Developmental Research Program for pilot studies and a Career Enhancement Program to foster careers in translational research related to the focus of the SPORE.",

          "Description": "NEH is soliciting proposals from institutions to participate in the National Digital Newspaper Program (NDNP). NDNP is creating a national digital resource of historically significant newspapers published between 1836 and 1922, from all the states and U.S. territories. This searchable database will be permanently maintained at the Library of Congress (LC) and will be freely accessible via the Internet. (See the website, Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers.) An accompanying national newspaper directory of bibliographic and holdings information on the website directs users to newspaper titles available in all types of formats. During the course of its partnership with NEH, LC will also digitize and contribute to the NDNP database a significant number of newspaper pages drawn from its own collections. NEH intends to support projects in all states and U.S. territories, provided that sufficient funds allocated for this purpose are available. One organization within each U.S. state or territory will receive an award to collaborate with relevant state partners in this effort. Previously funded projects will be eligible to receive supplements for continued work, but the program will give priority to new projects. In particular, the program will give priority to projects from states and territories that have not received NDNP funding. Applications that involve collaboration between previously funded and new projects are welcome. Such collaborations might involve, for example, arranging with current awardees to manage the creation and delivery of digital files; offering regular and ongoing consultation on managing aspects of the project; or providing formal training for project staff at an onsite institute or workshop. Over a period of two years, successful applicants will select newspapers&amp;#191;published in their state or territory between 1836 and 1922&amp;#191;and convert approximately 100,000 pages into digital files (primarily from microfilm), according to the technical guidelines (PDF) outlined by the Library of Congress. Applicants may select titles published in Danish, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, Norwegian, Portuguese, Spanish, and Swedish. (More languages will be added in future years.)",

CFDA: 15.945 &amp;#150; Cooperative Research and Training Programs &amp;#150; Resources of the National Park System Develop and Implement Artist-in-Residence Program at Sitka National Historical Park Project Abstract: Through this agreement, the National Park Service (NPS) will work with Alaska Geographic (AKGEO) to set up and administer a pilot Artist in Residence Program at Sitka National Historical Park. This collaboration will ensure that Native cultural demonstrations and interpretive programming at Sitka National Historical Park&amp;#146;s cultural center will continue uninterrupted through September of 2012. Background: Sitka National Historical Park&amp;#146;s Foundation Statement expressly states that the park will &amp;#147;foster the preservation and interpretation of Southeast Alaska Native culture.&amp;#148; Historically, this goal had been achieved through a longstanding partnership with the non-profit Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center (SEAICC). Since a cooperative agreement with SEAICC was not signed in 2011, the park is developing an alternative strategy for successfully meeting the same objective. Artist-in- Residence program will be established in 2012, then evaluated and adapted for future years to fulfill SITK&amp;#146;s mission and meet the public interest in the culture of Southeast Alaska. This program has been designed to recruit four volunteer artists; two of the artists will be Sitka Native artists volunteering for four months each and the other two Native artists (either local or non-local) who will volunteer for two months each. Over the years, Alaska Geographic has played a substantial role in supporting the park&amp;#146;s demonstration arts program. The NPS and Alaska Geographic wish to continue their support of this educational programming by creating Artist-in-Residence (AIR) program at Sitka National Historical Park. An AIR program will ensure that Alaska Native cultural demonstrations and interpretive programming at the park&amp;#146;s cultural center will be featured during 2012. Project Description: Alaska Geographic will partner with the National Park Service to develop an Artist-in-Residence program that targets Southeast Alaska Native artists skilled in traditional arts. Alaska Geographic will play a substantial role in supporting the cultural demonstration program at Sitka National Historical Park by: &amp;#149; Publicizing and advertising the program throughout Southeast Alaska; &amp;#149; Assisting the AIR program coordinator, a National Park Service employee, with the juried selection process; &amp;#149; Facilitating logistics of artists&amp;#146; visits and attendant travel and housing details; &amp;#149; Purchasing of supplies and materials; &amp;#149; Developing, coordinating, and sponsoring workshops, conference and symposia on southeast Alaska Native cultures. Objectives of the project will be: &amp;#149; To establish and administer a prototype Artist-in-Residence program, evaluate, adapt, and operate an Artist-in-Residence program or similar program in succeeding years if deemed desirable; &amp;#149; To enable Sitka National Historical Park to continue to succeed in fostering the preservation and perpetuation of Southeast Alaska Native arts and traditions; &amp;#149; To provide local residents and visitors with opportunities to learn about Southeast Alaska cultural values and activities. JUSTIFICATION FOR OTHER THAN FULL AND OPEN COMPETITION (or SINGLE SOURCE) FOR DISCRETIONARY COOPERATIVE AGREEMENTS _______________________________________________ TITLE: Develop and Implement Artist-in-Residence Program at Sitka National Historical Park BACKGROUND: For the past 42 years, Sitka National Historical Park had a cooperating partner, the Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center. The Center housed resident and demonstration arts programs, provided workshops, generated art for displays and acted as a key resource for perpetuating Southeast Alaska Native art and culture. Its function and mission was closely aligned with the park&amp;#146;s own mission of perpetuating key elements of Southeast Alaska Native culture, as embodied in totem poles, metal-working art forms and weaving art forms. In 2011, after several years during which the Center had a constantly-rotating board and executive director, and was not able to generate funding to support its operations and programs, the National Park Service decided not to sign a new agreement, and the relationship ended. Because the mission of the park involves the perpetuation of Native culture and art, and because the visitor experience at the park is closely intertwined with the presence of Native artists, the park has sought a partner who can manage the strategy and execution of a Native Artist-in Residence program during the peak visitor season in the summer of 2012 and potentially generate a prototype model which can be used in the future. Single Source Justification: 1) 505 DM 2 Single Source - Only one responsible source will satisfy agency requirements. &amp;#149; Alaska Geographic is a cooperating agency of the Sitka National Historical Park, and is uniquely positioned to act as a partner with Sitka National Historical Park&amp;#146;s Interpretive and Cultural Resource Teams on this Artist-in-Residence project. Alaska Geographic has recently partnered with the park on three of the park&amp;#146;s major Centennial events, the March 2010 birthday celebration, the 2010 International Conference on Russian America and the installation of the Kiks.adi Survival March Plaque. All three events had deep involvement of Tlingit artists, elders and clans. Alaska Geographic has for many years maintained a bookstore and/or kiosk at the park, and has reviewed, edited, selected and sold many works of literature and art associated with the work of Native artists. Alaska Geographic knows our public and the Native art forms. Alaska Geographic knows Alaska history. It has intimate knowledge of the park, the clans and the Native tradition, all of which will figure prominently in this proposed program of Artists in Residence. In addition, Alaska Geographic has membership, web outreach and publications which will make possible the widest possible dissemination of information about this program, and about the park and the people which define its historic and present-day connections and importance to perpetuation of Native art. 2) Nature and description of the deliverables required to meet the agency&amp;#146;s needs: &amp;#149; Description of the deliverables and the required delivery schedule. o Alaska Geographic will develop with the park a program plan, to ensure the visiting artists program is set up to be a successful element of the park visitor experience. This program plan should be completed by February 15, 2012. o Alaska Geographic will develop with the park a plan for soliciting and selecting the visiting artists, and scheduling the sequence of their tenures at the park. These steps should be completed by March 1, 2012. o Alaska Geographic will work with Sitka National Historical Park to manage the inauguration of the program through on-site presence as the summer visitor season begins, on May 5, 2012. o Alaska Geographic will develop and forward an after-action report and detailed expenditures report at the completion of the program, by October 31, 2012. &amp;#149; The minimum essential characteristics or unique features of the item(s). If requesting a service, fully describe all services to be performed. o Joining with park planners to lay out essential features of the visiting artists program &amp;#150; who should be invited based on artistic merit and reputation, how the program should be conducted, and what public events should be included as elements of the summer visiting artists program. o Joining with park planners to identify key clan leaders to identify the key support to be provided each artist, including studio space, supplies, connections to clan, tribe and other native organizations, public notice of the program and their presence, housing, honoraria and other support. o Consulting and advising the park planners on how the program can most effectively be recorded and then made available to the public, including through traditional and social media, including NPS and Alaska Geogrpahic publications and web sites. &amp;#149; State the price of the requirement &amp;#150; base year and every additional anticipated agreement period thereafter. o Base year FY 2012: For visiting artist travel: $1500 o Base year FY 2012: For Alaska Geographic staff travel and accommodation at the event: $1,000 o For visiting artists&amp;#146; honoraria: $4,500 o For artists&amp;#146; supplies and studio maintenance: $1,000 o For four months of artists&amp;#146; housing: $7,670 (please note&amp;#151;the price reflects elevated summer rates) o For program events: $500 o Base Year FY2012: For indirect costs at 17.5%: $2830 3) Criteria for justifying award without competition. In order for an assistance award to be made without competition, the award must satisfy one or more of the following criteria. Please explain which criterion specifically addresses the proposed agreement. &amp;#149; Unique Qualifications Alaska Geographic is uniquely qualified to work as Sitka National Historical Park&amp;#146;s partner in this event because of a combination of factors that is possessed by no other organization: years of experience working with the park; years of experience working with Native issue and specifically with the culture and history of Southeast Alaska Native people; a reach and depth of audience that is deeply invested in preserving the cultural, historic and natural resources of Alaska, such as is embodied in the park itself; specific expertise on programs with such roots in culture and history; specific experience with and support of the park&amp;#146;s Centennial events already completed; and specific expertise with a highly successful Artist-in-Resident program with another national park, Denali. 4) A description of the market research that was conducted and the results, or a statement of the reason a market research was not conducted: &amp;#149; The type and degree of market survey conducted. o A market research was not formally conducted. Sitka National Historical Park did, however, discuss other organizations with some potential to partner with us. None has the capacity to execute such a program. 5) Any other facts supporting the use of other than full and open competition: Although the Southeast Alaska Indian Cultural Center has provided a connection with Southeast arts by housing demonstration projects and some workshops, the Artist in Residence program is an established NPS program which is not comparable. 6) A statement of the actions, if any, the agency may take to remove or overcome any barriers for competition before any potential future agreement award: &amp;#149; If known, provide information on any new technology or new source that will be available in the future. &amp;#149; Describe any measures being taken to foster competition for future acquisitions of the same item or service. o During the past 18 months, Sitka National Historical Park has managed or co-managed seven major events &amp;#150; the March 2010 100th anniversary celebration, the June 2010 Alutiiq-Tlingit Cultural Sharing, the August 2010 International Conference on Russian America, the October 2010 Alaska Day Festival whose theme was the park&amp;#146;s centennial, the February 2011 Survival March Plaque dedication and installation, the May 2011 Centennial Totem Pole Raising, and the August 2011 Tlingit-Alutiiq Cultural Sharing. Each of the events had partners. And each event had a primary partner that was different, although some partners have participated in more than one event, Alaska Geographic among them. The park staff has sought to built and strengthen partnerships with a variety of non-profit agencies. For example, Sitka Historical Society was a major partner for the Russian American Conference. Sitka Cultural Center and the National Park Foundation were primary partners for the Alutiiq-Tlingit Culural Sharing, while the Woody Island Tribe of Kodiak was the partner for the reciprocal event, the Tlingit-Alutiiq Culutral Sharing. We are consciously trying to engage as many quality partners in these events, of which Alaska Geographic and the Artists in Residence program is another example. Our goal as outlined in the GPRA partnership metrics is to build the park&amp;#146;s relationships with community organizations and non-profits. This will continue into the future.",

Successful applicants will receive awards in the form of a cooperative agreement for the base year. Two additional option years may be exercised, subject to the availability of funding and the WBC&amp;apos;s performance during the previous year. An SBA women&amp;apos;s business center is a program or project funded, in part, by a grant from the SBA to provide technical assistance, such as training and counseling to women entrepreneurs, both nascent and owners of existing businesses. The WBC may exist within the framework of a larger economic development organization and may make use of the resources provided by that organization, and must be a clearly identifiable separate program or project of that entity. The function of the Women&amp;apos;s Business Center Program Renewal Grant is to provide continued funding for women&amp;apos;s business centers to provide technical assistance to women entrepreneurs, both nascent and established. A representative number of clients served by each WBC must be socially and economically disadvantaged. WBC grant recipients must provide assistance to women entrepreneurs in the areas of finance, management, marketing, and other areas as defined in Program Announcement OWBO-2012-02. Program authority is detailed in the Small Business Act, Sections 2(h) and 29 (15 U.S.C. Sections 631(h) and 656), as amended. Award recipients must provide non-federal matching funds as follows: one non-federal dollar for each federal dollar. Up to 50% of the non-federal matching funds may in the form of in-kind contributions and at least 50% of the non-federal matching funds must be in cash.",

          "Description": "USDOL/ILAB intends to award up to USD 2 million for one cooperative agreement to fund a technical assistance project in Peru. The purpose for funding this project is to help build the labor law enforcement capacity of the Peruvian labor inspectorate, with a focus on the Ministry of Labor and Employment Promotion (MTPE)&amp;#146;s newly-formed National Superintendency of Labor Inspection or Superintendencia Nacional de Fiscalizaci&amp;#243;n Laboral (SUNAFIL). The project will help the MTPE in its transition from a decentralized to a more centralized labor law enforcement system and will help ensure more effective labor law enforcement at the national and regional levels. The project will focus particularly on improving the MTPE&amp;apos;s enforcement of laws, regulations, and other legal instruments governing subcontracting/outsourcing and the use of short-term employment contracts, especially in the nontraditional export sectors (e.g., mining, agriculture, fishing, and textiles). The duration of the project funded by this announcement is up to 4.5 years (54 months) from the effective date of award. The project start date will be negotiated upon award of the individual cooperative agreement but will be no later than December 31, 2014. ILAB&amp;#146;s mission is to use all available international channels to improve working conditions, raise living standards, protect workers&amp;#146; ability to exercise their rights, and address the workplace exploitation of children and other vulnerable populations. ILAB is authorized to award and administer cooperative agreements by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, Pub. Law 113-76. Cooperative agreements awarded under this solicitation will be administered by the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) and technically managed by ILAB&amp;#146;s Office of Trade and Labor Affairs (OTLA). The mission of OTLA is to implement trade-related labor policy and coordinate international technical cooperation in support of the labor provisions in free trade agreements; to develop and implement the Department of Labor&amp;apos;s policy positions on international economic and trade issues; and to fund and oversee technical assistance projects addressing worker rights issues in key trading partner countries.",

The scope of this effort and the priorities attached to specific projects are influenced by changes in military and civilian medical science and technology, operational requirements, military threat assessments, and national defense strategies. The extramural research and development programs play a vital role in the fulfillment of the objectives established by the USAMRMC. General information on USAMRMC can be obtained at https://mrmc.detrick.army.mil/. This Fiscal Year 2015 (FY15) Broad Agency Announcement (BAA) is intended to solicit extramural research and development ideas and is issued under the provisions of the Competition in Contracting Act of 1984 (Public Law 98-369), as implemented in Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) 6.102(d)(2) and 35.016. In accordance with FAR 6.102, projects funded under this BAA must be for basic and applied research and that part of development not related to the development of a specific system or hardware procurement. Projects must be for scientific study and experimentation directed toward advancing the state-of-the-art or increasing knowledge or understanding rather than focusing on a specific system or hardware solution. Research and development funded through this BAA is intended and expected to benefit and inform both military and civilian medical practice and knowledge. This FY15 BAA is continuously open for a 12-month period, from October 1, 2014 through September 30, 2015, at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time. Submission of a pre-proposal/pre-application is required and must be submitted through the new electronic Biomedical Research Application Portal (eBRAP) (https://eBRAP.org/). Pre-proposal/pre-applications may be submitted at any time throughout the 12-month period. If the USAMRMC is interested in receiving a full proposal/application, the PI will be sent an invitation to submit via eBRAP. A full proposal/application must be submitted through Grants.gov (http://www.grants.gov/). Invited full proposals/applications can be submitted under the FY15 BAA through September 30, 2015.",

These may include special collections of books and journals, archives and manuscripts, prints and photographs, moving images, sound recordings, architectural and cartographic records, decorative and fine art objects, textiles, archaeological and ethnographic artifacts, furniture, historical objects, and digital materials. Applicants must draw on the knowledge of consultants whose preservation skills and experience are related to the types of collections and the nature of the activities that are the focus of their projects. Within the conservation field, for example, conservators usually specialize in the care of specific types of collections, such as objects, paper, or paintings. Applicants should therefore choose a conservator whose specialty is appropriate for the nature of their collections. Similarly, when assessing the preservation needs of archival holdings, applicants must seek a consultant specifically knowledgeable about archives and preservation. Because the organization and the preservation of archival collections must be approached in tandem, an archival consultant should also provide advice about the management and processing needs of such holdings as part of a preservation assessment that includes long-term plans for the arrangement and description of archival collections. Small and mid-sized institutions that have never received an NEH grant are especially encouraged to apply.",

In recognition of the importance of the dual policy goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing climate resilience , the DOE? ? in close collaboration with other Federal agencies ? is launching an initiative to identify and showcase U.S. local and tribal governments that have proven to be climate leaders through pursuing opportunities to advance both of these goals in their communities. In particular, the initiative will select 10-15 U.S. local governments and tribal governments ? or regional collaborations or consortia thereof ? that demonstrate a strong and ongoing commitment to implementing strategies that both reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance climate resilience, with a particular emphasis on strategies that further both goals. The DOE-led effort will provide a platform for other Federal agencies to participate in, and give leverage to, the activities of communities that are selected for this initiative. The Climate Action Champions competition will recognize local, regional, and tribal government entities that are leading emissions reductions and climate resilience efforts. DOE will work with other Federal partners to provide recognized entities with additional opportunities for financial and technical assistance, as well as facilitated peer-to-peer networking opportunities and mentorship, to support and advance their greenhouse gas emissions reduction and climate resilience objectives. This initiative will have the added objective of aligning assets at the Federal level and marshalling private, public, and philanthropic dollars at the local level.

The aim of the center will be to develop a set of parameters and strategies that will establish design criteria regarding the properties of chemicals that will lead to the development of intrinsically less hazardous substances when compared to those currently used in society. These newly acquired criteria and design principles will direct researchers towards the generation of novel chemicals that will minimize, and preferably eliminate, associated potential environmental and human health impacts that may occur during the life cycle of that chemical. The advent of these novel chemicals and their respective discovery of correlations between a chemical&amp;#146;s inherent properties and their adverse impacts require the development of improved methods for the design of next generation chemicals.",

          "Description": "The Secretary of the Interior established the Land Buy-Back Program for Tribal Nations (Buy-Back Program, Program) to implement the land consolidation provisions of the Cobell Settlement Agreement, which provided $1.9 billion to consolidate fractional land interests across Indian country. The Buy-Back Program allows interested individual owners to sell their land for immediate transfer to the recognized tribe that exercises jurisdiction. This effort will strengthen tribal sovereignty and put decision-making in the hands of the tribal government, freeing up resources that have been locked-up as land interests that have fractionated over time. The Buy-Back Program is interested in partnering with eligible tribes to gain their direct participation in land consolidation efforts given tribes&amp;#146; unique qualifications to perform land consolidation activities for their reservations. Consequently, the Program intends to, whenever feasible and practical, enter into single source cooperative agreements with eligible tribes to not only capitalize on their unique knowledge of their reservations but also to improve the overall effectiveness and efficiency of the Program. Eligible tribes will be given the opportunity to apply for a cooperative agreement, if desired, prior to the implementation of the Buy-Back Program at the location under their jurisdiction. More information is available at: http://www.doi.gov/buybackprogram/tribes/agreements.cfm. Tribes are encouraged to contact Program staff for more information on developing the cooperative agreement application prior to submission. Tribes are not required to enter into cooperative agreements to participate in the Program. In certain cases, it may be unnecessary and other vehicles, such as memorandums of agreements, may be used. The Settlement Agreement limits the amount of funding that may be used for implementation costs associated with the Program (e.g., outreach, land research, and appraisals). Thus, to help ensure that it stays within the established limit on implementation costs, the Program will fund indirect costs through cooperative agreements equal to no more than 15% of the modified total direct costs. PLEASE NOTE: This is a 10-year program. The expiration on this posting reflects this current opportunity, and new opportunities will be posted over the duration of the Program. In addition, given that the Cobell Settlement specifically limits overall implementation costs for the duration of the Program, cooperative agreement awards are not intended to fund or support long-term, multi-year programs at each location or reservation. Most awards will provide funding for no longer than 1 year, and tribes are encouraged to utilize the award amount to work with existing tribal land offices and programs. Tribes are also encouraged to first review mapping and other information available from the Program and to work with Program staff in the in development of the cooperative agreement application.",

The intent of the award is to restore and enhance brackish tidal wetland health and resiliency in the Mud, Mill and Baldridge Creek watersheds, Pennsville Township, Salem County, New Jersey. Brackish tidal marshes are a critical component of the Delaware Bay estuary system. The initial phase will be to complete the analysis of site conditions, including but not limited to riparian habitat conditions, drainage, flows, and sediment characterizations, wetland assessment, and topographic surveys and modeling to evaluate the feasibility of removing the stone revetments, and enhancing and creating brackish tidal marshes in the Mud, Mill and Baldridge Creek watersheds. This will be followed immediately by design, permitting, replacement of stone revetments with living shorelines, wetland habitat enhancements and creation of a tidal riverine wetland in Goose Pond. This award is issued to provide financial assistance to collaboratively-developed priority projects in Hurricane Sandy disaster areas that will restore environmental resources through collaborative efforts with local communities. The project is expected to restore ecosystem function, enhance the resiliency of the Mud, Mill and Baldridge Creek watersheds to sea level rise, and to provide improved fish and wildlife habitat. This project was previously vetted and approved for funding by the Department of the Interior. The appropriation for this project is the Hurricane Sandy Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriation Act of 2013, Public Law 113-2. Criteria for funding was based on the project&amp;#191;s ability to yield the greatest return on investment by taking advantage of existing science and regional planning tools for resiliency and by working with states, cities, communities, and partners who contribute to the goals of restoring and rebuilding national wildlife refuges and other federal public assets; and to increase resiliency and the capacity of coastal habitat and infrastructure and to withstand future storms and to minimize the damage incurred.",

          "Description": "The Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (P.L. 108-265) amended Section 22 of the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (NSLA), to establish a requirement that State agencies (SAs) conduct additional administrative reviews (AARs) of selected local educational agencies. It also amended Section 7 of the Child Nutrition Act to provide funding for States to be used for administrative reviews and training of local educational agencies. Both of these requirements are focused on school food authorities (SFAs) which have demonstrated a high level of, or a high risk for, administrative error. To assist SAs in achieving these requirements, the USDA Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) will fund FY 2012 Administrative Review and Training (ART) Method I Grants. The ART Method I grant funds will be available only to the 57 SAs that administer the National School Lunch Program (NSLP) for the purpose of conducting AARs of SFAs that have demonstrated a high level of, or a high risk for, administrative error. ART Method I grant funding will be awarded to assist SAs in conducting AARs as required under Section 22 of the NSLA. An AAR in the NSLP includes, but is not limited to, a review of applications, certification, verification, and/or meal counting, and meal claiming procedures. These areas are covered by the Coordinated Review Effort (CRE) Performance Standard (PS1) and the verification component of the general areas of review. The CRE procedures for these areas, as specified in 7 CFR 210.18, must be used to conduct the additional review(s) unless alternate procedures are approved by FNS. If an AAR results in significant findings, the SA must conduct a follow-up review to confirm that all required corrective actions have been implemented. The requirement for AARs of such SFAs for school year 2011-2012 is described in FNS Memorandum SP 48-2011 (Additional Administrative Reviews (AAR) and State Retention of Improperly-Paid Funds in School Year (SY) 2011-2012, September 6, 2011), which can be found on the Agency&amp;#146;s PartnerWeb at https://www.partnerweb.usda.gov and FNS website at http://www.fns.usda.gov/cnd/Governance/policy.htm.",

It was established in 2004 with the goal of ensuring safe and sufficient blood supply for the country. Prior to 2004, blood was obtained solely from family replacement donors at fragmented hospital based transfusion units that lacked standardization of procedures. The Policy guidelines on blood transfusion in (2006) recommended a shift from hospital based transfusion service to centralized system which would later be semi-autonomous and independent. This system ensures standardization with improved quality of blood supply and thus less transmission of HIV and other transfusion transmissible infections (TTIs). It also ensures that the same standard operating procedures (SOPs) are used nationally in the various blood transfusion centers. It is therefore necessary for this work to be coordinated by NBTS under the MOHSW.  From 2005 to 2014, there have been two, five year cooperative agreements between CDC and NBTS.",

          "Description": "The purpose of this research is to design and test the feasibility of a surveillance system for congenital and inherited conditions that have low prevalence but high health and economic impact in the U.S. population that will support description of this population across the lifespan. Initial design of this surveillance system will focus on three conditions which exemplify different types of disorders: e.g. spina bifida is an example of a neurological condition affecting mobility; muscular dystrophy is an example of a neuromuscular condition; and fragile X syndrome is an example of a condition affecting cognition and behavior. The project will develop a prototype surveillance system that, if found effective, can serve as a model for other low prevalence/high impact conditions. There is currently no system or integrated approach to identify and describe persons affected by these conditions, thus limiting opportunities to understand, intervene, and improve health services and public health outcomes for those people affected with these conditions and their families. A system focused on low prevalence/high impact conditions may assist public health practitioners, clinicians, and other groups to: describe the epidemiology and the features of secondary health conditions associated with these disorders; monitor the progress of public health interventions, develop screening strategies for the detection of new cases, inform policies aimed at improving the healthcare delivered to these patients, and address potential differences or disparities in the impact of these conditions on the population. In short, this research effort will explore how different systems and data sources may be used to improve health services and health outcomes among people affected with selected conditions and their relatives.",

Art Works encourages and supports the following four outcomes: &amp;#149;Creation: The creation of art that meets the highest standards of excellence, &amp;#149;Engagement: Public engagement with diverse and excellent art, &amp;#149;Learning: Lifelong learning in the arts, and &amp;#149;Livability: The strengthening of communities through the arts. You will be asked to select the outcome that is most relevant to your project, and you also will be able to select a secondary outcome (note that all Arts Education applicants must choose the Learning outcome as their primary outcome).

          "Description": "National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Headquarters is releasing an Appendix to the current Space Technology Research, Development, Demonstration, and Infusion 2015 (REDDI) NASA Research Announcement (NRA) for initial studies of visionary aerospace concepts. NNH15ZOA001N, entitled NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts: Phase I Studies, will be available as of October 10th, 2014 by opening the NASA Research Opportunities homepage at http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ and then linking through the menu listings &amp;quot;Solicitations&amp;quot; to &amp;quot;Open Solicitations.&amp;quot; This NRA Appendix will solicit multiple studies, each of which will investigate an architecture, mission, or system concept with the potential to enable a great leap in space or aeronautics. Aerospace architecture, mission, or system concepts proposed for NIAC Phase I study must be exciting, unexplored, far-term, and credible. Proposals for narrow technology or subsystem development, or incremental or near-term advancement, are explicitly out of scope for this program. Finally, while NIAC encourages daring vision and accepts the accompanying risk, proposals must be technically credible and plausibly implementable. NIAC is part of the Space Technology Mission Directorate. The 2015 NIAC Phase I solicitation will be a two-step process. Step A will be a 3-page white paper plus summary chart. Proposals shall be submitted electronically, and all Step A proposers shall use the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES), accessible at http://nspires.nasaprs.com , or for Step A may also use Grants.gov. Step B full proposals will be eligible only if invited after review of a Step A submission. Step B proposals shall be submitted electronically through NSPIRES only. This solicitation will be an open announcement; anyone is welcome to respond. Affiliation with any educational institution, commercial or not-for-profit organization, research laboratory, government agency, or NASA Center (including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) is permitted. Individuals may submit, as long as they meet the registration requirements for NSPIRES. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. Each electronic proposal system places requirements on the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the electronic proposal system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Specific propo sal submission deadline dates, evaluation criteria, and submission information will be identified in the NRA. Step A White Papers will be due on or before Wednesday, November 12th, 2014; Step B full Proposals will be due on or before Wednesday, January 21st , 2015. 12-16 NIAC Phase I awards are anticipated, but the final number of awards will depend on the quality of proposals and availability of appropriated funds. Comments and questions may be addressed by e-mail to NIAC Program representatives at hq-niac@mail.nasa.gov . Responses to inquiries will be answered by e-mail and also included in the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) document located on the NSPIRES page associated with the solicitation; anonymity of persons/institutions who submit questions will be preserved.",

          "Description": "Overview: The purpose of CIG is to stimulate the development and adoption of innovative conservation approaches and technologies, while leveraging the Federal investment in environmental enhancement and protection in conjunction with agricultural production. CIG projects are expected to lead to the transfer of conservation technologies, management systems, and innovative approaches into NRCS policy, technical manuals, guides, and references, or to the private sector. CIG does not fund research projects. Projects intended to test hypotheses do not qualify for a CIG grant. CIG is used to apply or demonstrate previously proven technology. It is a vehicle to stimulate development and adoption of conservation approaches or technologies thathave been studied sufficiently to indicate a high likelihood of success, and that are a candidate for eventual technology transfer or institutionalization. CIG promotes sharing of skills,knowledge, technologies, and facilities among communities, governments, and other institutions to ensure that scientific and technological developments are accessible to a wider range of users. CIG funds projects targeting innovative on-the-ground conservation, including pilot projects and field demonstrations. A two-phase evaluation process will be utilized for applications submitted under this notice. The first phase requires the applicant to submit a pre-proposal. Applications will be evaluated by NRCS staff under the bulleted topics identified by the applicant (see section I.D). Applications will be screened for completeness and compliance with the provisions of this notice. Incomplete applications will be eliminated from competition, and notification of elimination will be mailed to the applicant. NRCS will accept applications for single or multi-year projects, not to exceed 3 years, submitted to NRCS from eligible entities including Federally recognized Indian tribes, State and local units of government, and non-governmental organizations and individuals. Applications are accepted from all 50 States, the Caribbean Area (Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands), and the Pacific Islands Area (Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands). NRCS will only request a full proposal package from those applicants selected in the preproposal process. Complete applications received by applicable deadlines will be evaluated by a technical peer review panel based on the Criteria for Application Evaluation identified in the application instructions in section VI.B. 4. Full proposal applications, along with their associated technical peer review, will be forwarded to the Grants Review Board. The Grants Review Board will make recommendations for project approval to the NRCS Chief who will make the final selections.",

The RFI offers the opportunity for interested individuals and organizations to provide recommendations on approaches for facilitating the creation and diffusion of agricultural technologies within the South and Southeast Asia regions. Stakeholders in the region, including farmers, policy-makers, researchers and the private sector, have identified technology transfer as holding great promise in addressing food security concerns in some of the poorest countries. The diversity across the region is an opportunity for stakeholders to learn from each other and share knowledge and materials across borders to provide improved tools for agricultural production and to reduce post-harvest loss, as well as stronger management systems, to their low-income farmers. As a regional mission, USAID/RDMA is well poised to facilitate action on this opportunity and spur innovation, adaptation, and diffusion throughout the region, with a focus on Feed the Future (FTF) countries (Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Nepal). USAID/RDMA&amp;#146;s Agricultural Learning Exchange for Asian Regional Networking (AgLEARN) ongoing activity has demonstrated some positive examples of technology adaptation and transfer. Using this as a foundation, the proposed activity will explore new pathways toward reaching the U.S. Government&amp;#146;s FTF initiative goals of inclusive agricultural sector growth and improved nutrition. In responding to this RFI, significant emphasis should be placed on discrete and actionable interventions USAID/RDMA could take to support agricultural technology innovation, adaptation, and transfer. Response to this RFI is voluntary. Responders are free to address any or all the above items, as well as provide additional information that they think is relevant to Technology Transfer in Asia. Please note USAID is not seeking technical or cost proposals at this time. Do not submit any proposal/application at this time. Only the information requested above will be considered. Issuance of this notice does not constitute an award commitment on the part of the U.S. Government, nor does it commit the Government to pay for any costs incurred in the preparation of comments.",

          "Description": "While the Office of Naval Research (ONR) continues to develop larger format Focal Plane Arrays (FPAs) to provide wide area coverage (e.g., ever increasing swath width) for Electro-Optics Infrared (EO-IR) sensors, it has been recognized that this approach will lead to ever increasing FPA costs. A more cost effective approach (especially for smaller unmanned aerial system (UAS) platforms), could be defined by an investigation of how to achieve sensor performance using smaller, more affordable FPAs by optimizing the imagery from these systems to meet detection, tracking and identification requirements. This BAA seeks to develop techniques to optimize imagery from passive and active EO-IR imaging sensors based on smaller, less expensive FPAs. Some past and on-going ONR efforts include coded sensor processing, compressive sensing, and &amp;quot;Lucky Imaging&amp;quot; algorithms. There may also be techniques for adding processing to read out integrated circuits (ROICs) that will enable better utilization of smaller FPAs. Although this effort is not intended to cover the development of new EO-IR sensor hardware, including FPAs and ROICs, the impact of this investigation may lead to the proposal and implementation of new sensor hardware architectures. The overall intent of the BAA is the development of image enhancement techniques and methodologies that can be incorporated in processing of imagery from a variety of different small-format EO-IR sensor architectures. This approach can greatly improve the Navy&amp;apos;s ability to achieve Information Dominance with a broader spectrum of lower-cost sensors.",

This NRA covers all aspects of basic and applied supporting research and technology in space and Earth sciences, including, but not limited to: theory, modeling, and analysis of SMD science data; aircraft, scientific balloon, sounding rocket, International Space Station, CubeSat, and suborbital reusable launch vehicle investigations; development of experiment techniques suitable for future SMD space missions; development of concepts for future SMD space missions; development of advanced technologies relevant to SMD missions; development of techniques for and the laboratory analysis of both extraterrestrial samples returned by spacecraft, as well as terrestrial samples that support or otherwise help verify observations from SMD Earth system science missions; determination of atomic and composition parameters needed to analyze space data, as well as returned samples from the Earth or space; Earth surface observations and field campaigns that support SMD science missions; development of integrated Earth system models; development of systems for applying Earth science research data to societal needs; and development of applied information systems applicable to SMD objectives and data. Awards range from under $100K per year for focused, limited efforts (e.g., data analysis) to more than $1M per year for extensive activities (e.g., development of science experiment hardware). The funds available for awards in each program element offered in this ROSES-2014 NRA range from less than one to several million dollars, which allows selection from a few to as many as several dozen proposals depending on the program objectives and the submission of proposals of merit. Awards will be made as grants, cooperative agreements, contracts, and inter- or intraagency transfers, depending on the nature of the proposing organization and/or program requirements. The typical period of performance for an award is four years, although a few programs may specify shorter or longer (maximum of five years) periods. Organizations of every type, domestic and foreign, Government and private, for profit and not-for-profit, may submit proposals without restriction on the number or teaming arrangements. Note that it is NASA policy that all investigations involving non-U.S. organizations will be conducted on the basis of no exchange of funds. Electronic submission of proposals is required by the respective due dates for each program element and must be submitted by an authorized official of the proposing organization. Electronic proposals may be submitted via the NASA proposal data system NSPIRES or via Grants.gov. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this ROSES-2014 NRA must be registered with NSPIRES; organizations that intend to submit proposals via Grants.gov must be registered with Grants.gov, in addition to being registered with NSPIRES. Such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. All principal investigators and other participants (e.g., co-investigators) must be registered in NSPIRES regardless of submission system. Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) of interest to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Details of the solicited programs are given in the Appendices of this ROSES-2014 NRA. Names, due dates, and links for the individual calls are given in Tables 2 and 3 of this ROSES-2014 NRA. Table 2, organized by due date, can be found at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2014table2 and Table 3, organized by subject area can be found at http://solicitation.nasaprs.com/ROSES2014table3. Interested proposers should monitor http://nspires.nasaprs.com/ or subscribe to the electronic notification system there for additional new programs or amendments to this ROSES NRA through February 2015, at which time release of a subsequent ROSES NRA is planned. A web archive (and RSS feed) for amendments, clarifications, and corrections to this ROSES-2014 NRA will be available at:http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations/roses-2014 Further information about specific program elements may be obtained from the individual Program Officers listed in the Summary of Key Information for each program element in the Appendices of this ROSES NRA and at http://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/program-officers-list/.

          "Description": "The purpose of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) is to provide regional access for cryoelectron microscopy (cryoEM) laboratories to state-of-the-art data collection capabilities. NIGMS will support consortia of established and early stage investigator laboratories whose research has an established specialization in and dependence on cryoEM. These laboratories will coordinate with each other to share facilities and resources for direct electron detection. Consortia will consist of a host institution which already has a modern high-performing cryoEM installation and proven capabilities for high-resolution data collection, partnered with regional participating institutions. A consortium will support surplus capacity for cryoEM data collection (infrastructure and services) at the host institution and make it available as a resource for the participating regional institutions. Projects will support access for cryoEM laboratories at participating institutions to resources and services at host sites. Projects will (a) contribute to the fixed costs of maintaining the host facility and extend services in proportion to the resources dedicated to the regional users and (b) support access to the facility by the regional laboratories. The host institution need not already have an electron detector; this FOA can help fund acquisition of direct detection equipment. Support is limited to enabling the participating cryoEM laboratories to collect data and perform the initial stages of processing raw images, and does not include other research activities. Consortia will consist of a minimum of 3-5 institutions; award budgets will depend on the number and data collection needs of the regional participating cryoEM laboratories. This initiative is not intended to support service centers of the traditional type in which the host laboratory performs the cryoEM analysis for non-specialist collaborators.",

These numbers are estimates. The actual number of awards will vary according to the number of applications and the size of awards. The estimated number of awards reflects the statutory goal of the CO-OP program to establish a CO-OP in each State. It should be noted, however, that the statute allows CMS to fund more than one eligible prospective CO-OP qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer in any State if the funding is sufficient to do so. However, CMS is unlikely to fund CO-OPs that will directly compete with each other for the same target market if actuarial analysis indicates that these CO-OPs would be less likely to repay loans under those circumstances. If there is no applicant from a State, CMS may award loans to encourage the expansion of a eligible prospective CO-OP qualified nonprofit health insurance issuer from another State to that State or take other steps to encourage the development of a CO-OP in a State. Additionally, an applicant may apply for loans to establish a CO-OP in more than one State. For the purposes of this Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA), a &amp;#147;State&amp;#148; means each of the 50 States and the District of Columbia.

          "Description": "The OPORP Orthotics and Prosthetics Outcomes Research Award (OPORA) is being offered for the first time in FY14. It is intended to support research that evaluates the comparative effectiveness of and functional outcomes associated with prosthetic and orthotic clinical interventions and/or other rehabilitation interventions for Service Members and Veterans who have undergone limb salvage or limb amputation. The goal is to improve our understanding of and ultimately advance the implementation of the most effective prescriptions for prosthetic and orthotic devices, treatment, rehabilitation, and secondary health effect prevention options for patients, clinicians, other caregivers, and policymakers. Proposed projects should be designed to provide outcomes data regarding orthotic and prosthetic devices, and/or related clinical interventions and must include the anticipated effect on patient care metrics. Collaboration with military researchers and clinicians is encouraged, as are joint Department of Defense (DoD)-VA studies, including longitudinal outcome studies. Studies are sought that: &amp;#149; Compare different patient care approaches. &amp;#149; Include patient-centric outcome assessments. &amp;#149; Have the potential to generate new knowledge that can be developed into new clinical practice guidelines, and/or new prescription algorithms for prosthetic and orthotic devices. &amp;#149; Have the potential to develop new technology for improved prosthetic and orthotic devices, therefore improving patient outcomes. &amp;#149; Provide information on quality of life, reintegration, and/or return to duty/return to work as it pertains to those patients who use a prosthetic or orthotic device due to limb trauma. All applications must demonstrate direct relevance to Service Members and Veterans with traumatic extremity injury and/or amputation using prosthetics and orthotic devices. Examples of studies that are appropriate for submission to the FY14 OPORA include, but are not limited to, examination of the long-term functional and patient-centered outcomes associated with: &amp;#149; The specific time points in the course of patient treatment where prosthetic and orthotic intervention is the most effective. &amp;#149; Different treatment algorithms to determine the most appropriate prosthetic/orthotic device. &amp;#149; The effect of different orthotic and/or prosthetic devices on achievement of maximal functional ability. &amp;#149; Development of outcomes evaluating the prevention of secondary adverse consequences of prosthetic and orthotic device use, including but not limited to falls, skin breakdown, loss of balance. &amp;#149; Improvement of current prosthetic and orthotic materials and techniques to improve quality of life and health outcomes for patients with limb trauma or limb loss. &amp;#149; Development of new materials and technologies for use in orthotics and prosthetics to improve quality of life and health outcomes for patients with limb trauma or limb loss. &amp;#149; Application of specific rehabilitation interventions to accelerate the time, course, or extent of functional outcomes in Service Members and Veterans using prosthetic and orthotic devices. Studies may also be proposed that consider outcome factors related to health care delivery and clinical decision-making such as cost, accessibility, adoption of medical policy, and patient preferences. Studies should have a clinical focus and may include methodologies and designs such as surveys, retrospective data analyses, simulation modeling, longitudinal observation, cross sectional observation, case control, or qualitative research study designs. Animal studies are not allowed under this award mechanism. Research Scope: Research proposed under the FY14 OPORA may include small- to large-scale projects and be at different stages of idea and research development including efficacy studies, effective comparison studies, human use, observational studies, and clinical trials. Two different funding levels, based on the scope of the research, are available under this Program Announcement/Funding Opportunity. Clinical research and clinical trials will be considered for both funding levels. It is the responsibility of the Principal Investigator (PI) to select the funding level that is most appropriate for the proposed research project. The following are general descriptions, although not all-inclusive, of the scope of research projects that would be appropriate to propose under each funding level: &amp;#149; Funding Level 1: Research that is already supported by preliminary data and has the potential to make significant advancements toward clinical translation. &amp;#149; Funding Level 2: Advanced translational studies that have the potential for near-term clinical investigation.",

          "Description": "The purpose of this Notice is to provide potential applicants advance notice that the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) intends to issue, on behalf of the Wind and Water Power Technologies Office, a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled ?Wind Energy Bat Impact Minimization Technologies and Field Testing Opportunities.? To address and minimize the regulatory and financial risks associated with wind power development in locations with sensitive bat species, the Department of Energy?s Wind and Water Power Technologies Office (WWPTO) seeks through this FOA to fund projects that advance the technical and commercial readiness of bat impact mitigation and minimization technologies including, but not limited to, bat deterrents and operational changes that have a high likelihood of reducing bat mortality at a facility. This FOA will also support the demonstration and evaluation of near-commercial bat impact mitigation technologies at operational wind facilities. These technologies, once successfully demonstrated, will provide regulators and wind facility owner-operators with viable and cost effective tools to reduce bat mortality at wind facilities and ease the regulatory and financial uncertainty related to the development and long-term operation of wind farms in bat habitat. NO APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED THROUGH THIS NOTICE. Please do not submit questions or respond to this Notice of Intent. Prospective applicants to the FOA should begin developing partnerships, formulating ideas, and gathering data in anticipation of the issuance of this FOA. EERE plans to issue the FOA in the first Quarter of Fiscal Year 2015 (by December 31, 2014). The applicant must first register and create an account on the EERE eXCHANGE website. A User Guide for EERE eXCHANGE can be found on the EERE website https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/Manuals.aspx after logging in to the system.",

Please review the official application notice for pre-application and application requirements, application submission information, performance measures, priorities and program contact information. Purpose of Program: The Statewide, Longitudinal Data Systems program awards grants to State educational agencies (SEAs) to design, develop, and implement statewide, longitudinal data systems to efficiently and accurately manage, analyze, disaggregate, and use individual student data. The Department&amp;apos;s long-term goal in operating the program is to help all States create comprehensive P-20W (early learning through workforce) systems that foster the generation and use of accurate and timely data, support analysis and informed decision-making at all levels of the education system, increase the efficiency with which data may be analyzed to support the continuous improvement of education services and outcomes, facilitate research to improve student academic achievement and close achievement gaps, support education accountability systems, and simplify the processes used by SEAs to make education data transparent through Federal and public reporting. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance (CFDA) Number: 84.372A. On September 20, 2011, we published in the Federal Register (76 FR 58252) a notice inviting applications for the Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems FY 2012 competition. That notice established a December 15, 2012, deadline date for eligible applicants to apply for funding under this program. As a result of the notice published on September 20, 2011, 31 eligible entities submitted applications. In order to ensure fairness and afford as many eligible applicants as possible an opportunity to be considered for funding under this program, we are reopening the Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems FY 2012 competition to eligible applicants that were not able to submit applications by the original deadline date. Thus, we will consider as received timely, all of the applications we received through Grants.gov by December 15, 2011 (referred to as ``previously submitted applications&amp;apos;&amp;apos; in this notice), and will consider as timely any additional applications or revisions to any previously submitted application submitted by the new deadline date established in this notice. All information in the September 20, 2011 notice remains the same for new applications and revisions to previously submitted applications submitted in response to this reopening notice, except for the following updates to the Dates section and section V.

          "Description": "The principal objective of the Natural Resource Damage Assessment (NRDA) 2012 Multi-year Implementation Grants is to administer funds for sub-awarded coastal habitat conservation and restoration projects. The funded projects/sub-awards will be selected through NRDA restoration planning processes in response to natural resource injuries and lost use of natural resources due to those injuries. NOAA acts as a trustee on behalf of the public to protect and restore coastal and marine resources. For almost 20 years, NOAA has worked cooperatively with responsible parties (the individuals, companies, or government agencies responsible for an oil spill or hazardous substance release) and trustee councils (teams of state, tribal, and other federal agencies convened to respond to a specific spill, release, or grounding) to implement remedial actions that protect NOAA trust resources from additional harm. If an incident diminishes the services that natural resources provide, including human services (e.g., fishing, beach-going,) and ecological services (e.g., providing habitat, nutrient cycling), the trustees will seek to implement projects to restore those lost services. Since 1992, we have recovered more than $600 million from responsible parties to protect and restore coastal resources, including migratory fish, marine mammals, wetlands, reefs, and other coastal habitats. Applicants selected through this federal funding opportunity will be those capable of implementing trustee-selected NRDA restoration projects, or competitively soliciting projects to meet specific restoration goals determined by the trustee council. Projects selected by the trustees may be implemented through a subcontract to a specified organization, or may be directly implemented by the grantee requiring significant oversight, provided the trustees determine the applicant has relevant expertise. NOAA anticipates that approximately $750,000-$15,000,000 may be available to fund the awarded cooperative agreements over the life of any selected awards. Funding is expected to be provided on an as-available basis to maintain the grants for up to seven years, and is dependent upon the level of funding made available by trustee councils. NOAA anticipates that typical awards will range from $350,000 to $2,000,000 within the first year. NOAA will not accept proposals with a first year budget less than $300,000 or more than $5,000,000 under this solicitation.Eligible applicants are institutions of higher education, non-profits, and commercial (for-profit) organizations. Applications for federal, state, tribal, or local governments will not be considered, due to their potential role as trustee council members.",

          "Description": "The Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program provides support for independent graduate-level studies in oceanography, marine biology, or maritime archaeology (including all science, engineering, social science and resource management of ocean and coastal areas), and particularly encourages women and minorities to apply. Individuals who are U.S. citizens and are applying to or have been accepted to a graduate program at a U.S. accredited institution may apply. Prospective scholars do not need to be enrolled in a graduate program at the time of application, but must be admitted to a graduate level program in order to be awarded this scholarship. Scholarship selections are based on academic excellence, letters of recommendations, research and career goals, and financial need. Applicants must have a cumulative 3.3 grade point average to be eligible to apply and maintain a minimum cumulative and term grade point average of 3.3 for every term and for the duration of their award. Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarships may provide, subject to appropriations, yearly support of up to $42,000 per student (a 12-month stipend of $30,000 in addition to an education allowance of up to $12,000), and up to $10,000 of support for a 4-6 week program collaboration at a NOAA facility. Completion of one (1) program collaboration is required for every Doctoral scholarship award, with a second recommended, but not required. For Master&amp;apos;s degree level scholars, completion of a program collaboration is strongly recommended, but is not required. Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program recipients will be required to participate in a mandatory NOAA Orientation Training to meet with NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries staff at a date and location to be determined during the month of either the end of July or beginning of August, 2015. If scholarships have not been awarded before this training, recipients may be required to incur pre-award costs that will be reimbursed after award funds have been issued.As a recipient of the Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship, you become a recognized member of the NOAA community. NOAA provides significant financial resources to help you pursue your independent graduate studies, as well as the staff expertise to assist you with your research along the way. All Dr. Nancy Foster Scholarship Program recipients must put together a 3-5 minute video that communicates their scientific research in a way that the average viewer can understand it, as well as see why it matters to them. A camera with photo and video capabilities, along with guidelines, a storyboard and appropriate training will be provided to all Foster Scholars. The program collaboration opportunity is designed to allow scholars to participate in research or other activities for four to six weeks at a field office of the National Marine Sanctuary System, or other NOAA program offices. Federal support for the program collaboration may be used toward allowable costs such as: travel to and from the NOAA facility, housing, per diem, laboratory costs, research vessel support, and consumables while conducting research at the NOAA facility. Scholars are required to provide their own health insurance coverage during the program collaboration.Master&amp;apos;s degree level scholars must identify their program collaboration in the first year, and Doctoral scholars must identify their program collaboration within the first two years. Approval from the NOAA Office of National Marine Sanctuaries is required prior to embarking on the program collaboration.Additional information about the scholarship can be obtained in the full announcement text of the Federal Funding Opportunity.",

          "Description": "Avian Health and Disease Program Region 2 Request for Proposals FY 2012 Grants.gov Announcement I. Purpose This announcement solicits proposals for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&amp;#146;s (USFWS&amp;#146;s) Southwest Avian Health and Disease Program. In 2012, this program will provide small grants for the conservation of birds that are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Proposals should address the geographic area that includes Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona. This region is an important wintering and stop-over area for migratory birds. Factors affecting habitat conditions, immune status, and disease prevalence are of great significance to the health of migratory bird populations utilizing this region. This grant program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance at: https://www.cfda.gov/index?s=program&amp;amp;mode=form&amp;amp;tab=step1&amp;amp;id=0304cd16f0f0b2aef93ceaf90df29800 Avian Health and Disease: The Avian Health and Disease program (AHD) supports avian conservation, surveillance and monitoring goals of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by including health and disease assessments into activities related to the management of all migratory bird species. In 2012, we seek proposals to: a. Establish avian health baselines; b. Identify existing and emerging avian health and disease issues, especially viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases; c. Identify linkages among the epidemiological triad of susceptible host, capable agent, and suitable environment that enhance disease expression; d. Develop, guide, and implement appropriate and effective avian disease management actions. e. Ensure disease preparedness and prevention Before submitting proposals on any of the above topics, we strongly encourage you to contact Dan Collins, Migratory Game Bird Coordinator, USFWS Division of Migratory Birds (505-248-6881; dan_collins@fws.gov), to discuss potential projects. He will help you further develop your proposal ideas. To prepare a complete proposal, authors should have a copy of this Avian Health and Disease Program-Region 2 Request for Proposals (FY2012) and the FWS Avian Health and Disease Program National Strategic Plan. These can be obtained from Dan Collins. II. History This program was created in 2011 to address the needs of birds that are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Increasing expansion of human populations has led to habitat fragmentation, changes in land-use patterns, and increased pressure on wild bird populations. Globalization of marketing and distribution has increased zoonotic and emerging disease risks. Many of these emerging diseases involve avian reservoirs or susceptible hosts. Increasing the complexity of this picture are changes in climate; avian populations may need to alter site fidelity in response to weather patterns, and this will introduce new opportunities for transmission of avian diseases and place pressure on populations already stressed by anthropogenic factors. To address these issues, the USFWS established the Avian Health and Disease Program (AHDP) to conduct work in avian health and disease surveillance, response, and management in wild bird populations. III. The Process Each proposal should include the following information and be submitted as outlined below: A. TITLE SECTION IV.A. Title of Project IV.B. Principal Investigator (include full contact information) IV.C. Co-Investigators B. INTRODUCTION V.A. Background and Justification Briefly describe the project, including species, location, avian health issue or concern. V.B. Objective(s) List all objectives of the proposed project V.C. Management Action(s) Identify any on-going management activities associated with the proposed project (e.g., annual banding drive, aerial surveys etc) and any management actions that may result as a consequence of this project. C. METHODS VI.A. Data Collection Methods should be described with enough detail to allow reviewers of the proposal to clearly see how the objectives of the proposal will be met. Key elements to be described in this section include (1) type, number, and location samples to be collected and analyzed, (2) type of health parameter, pathogen or non-infectious agent to be addressed (3) Other information that will be collected as part of this or ancillary projects VI.B. Analysis Identify laboratory or other analyses that will be conducted on the samples. Briefly describe methods used for data analyses. D. RELEVANCE TO NATIONAL STRATEGIC PLAN Below are specific topics identified within the National Strategic Plan that should be considered in proposals seeking funding from the R2-AHD program: HEALTH AND DISEASE IMPACT INVESTIGATIONS Integrate health surveillance into field activities &amp;#149;Initiate or expand investigation of regionally specific avian health and disease problems &amp;#149;Collect baseline data on avian species to assess health and disease concerns &amp;#149;Evaluate critical avian populations: species of concern, threatened and endangered species (conduct field investigations in combination with the ongoing management activities) &amp;#149;Investigate infectious diseases (viruses, bacteria, fungal infections) &amp;#149;Investigate non-infectious diseases (parasites, biotoxins, contaminants) &amp;#149;Conduct targeted pathogen surveillance &amp;#149;Investigate indigenous and exotic disease problems Climate change &amp;#149;Incorporate AHD activities into DOI climate change strategic plans, LCCs, CCPs and other planning documents. &amp;#149;Integrate health surveillance with National Wildlife Refuges Inventories and Monitoring disease surveillance priorities &amp;#149;Investigate the impact of climate change on the biology of wildlife disease reservoirs and vector species &amp;#149;Investigate disease impacts on species adaptation strategies &amp;#149;Identify ancillary stressors influencing avian susceptibility to disease (decoupling of biological processes) Human-induced effects on disease transmission &amp;#149;Assess the increased disease risks associated with urban, suburban, and agricultural environments (water quality, habitat fragmentation, contaminants) &amp;#149;Aid in the prevention and management of invasive species introduction &amp;#149;Adjust FWS personnel behaviors during field activities to decrease the potential of disease transmission to humans, other wildlife, other geographic sites Describe how your project addresses any of the components listed in the section above.

          "Description": "Avian Health and Disease Program Region 1 Request for Proposals FY2012 INSTRUCTIONS TO AUTHORS This announcement solicits proposals for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service&amp;#146;s (USFWS&amp;#146;s) Pacific Region Avian Health and Disease (AHD) program. The AHD program supports avian conservation, surveillance and monitoring goals of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service by including health and disease assessments into activities related to the management of migratory bird species. Proposals should be relevant to native Migratory Birds in the Pacific Region (Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Hawaii and the Pacific Trust Territories). OBJECTIVES OF THE AVIAN HEALTH AND DISEASE PROGRAM Conduct health and disease surveillance of wild bird populations to: 1. Establish avian health baselines 2. Identify existing and emerging avian health and disease risks 3. Ensure disease preparedness and prevention 4. Develop, guide, and implement appropriate and effective management actions To address these objectives, we are requesting proposals that will allow us to provide support in one of the following areas: 1. Health and disease impact investigations 2. Technical assistance for management issues 3. Infrastructure and provisions needed for field operations 4. Morbidity and mortality monitoring, response and technical assistance 5. Personnel 6. Communications and informing policy 7. Collaborations Below are specific topics identified within the Avian Health and Disease National Strategic Plan (NSP) that could be considered in proposals seeking funding from the R1-AHD program. HEALTH AND DISEASE IMPACT INVESTIGATIONS Integrate health surveillance into field activities &amp;#149; Initiate or expand investigation of regionally specific avian health and disease problems &amp;#149; Collect baseline data on avian species to assess health and disease concerns &amp;#149; Evaluate critical avian populations: species of concern, threatened and endangered species (conduct field investigations in combination with the ongoing management activities) &amp;#149; Investigate infectious diseases (viruses, bacteria, fungal infections) &amp;#149; Investigate non-infectious diseases (parasites, biotoxins, contaminants) &amp;#149; Conduct targeted pathogen surveillance &amp;#149; Investigate indigenous and exotic disease problems Climate change &amp;#149; Incorporate AHD activities into DOI climate change strategic plans and the National Wildlife Refuges Inventories and Monitoring disease surveillance priorities &amp;#149; Investigate the impact of climate change on the biology of wildlife disease reservoirs and vector species &amp;#149; Investigate disease impacts on species adaptation strategies &amp;#149; Identify ancillary stressors influencing avian susceptibility to disease (decoupling of biological processes) Human-induced effects on disease transmission &amp;#149; Assess the increased disease risks associated with urban, suburban, and agricultural environments (water quality, habitat fragmentation, contaminants) &amp;#149; Aid in the prevention and management of invasive species introduction &amp;#149; Adjust FWS personnel behaviors during field activities to decrease the potential of disease transmission to humans, other wildlife, other geographic sites PROPOSAL DEVELOPMENT Funding for this program is subject to change without notice; therefore we are requesting that proposals be submitted for single-year projects only. If funding is available in future years, you will be given the option to submit a proposal for subsequent steps in a project. Projects should be organized in a manner that produces a measurable result from each independently-funded phase. Additional ranking criteria will be how well the project addresses the program objectives stated above and the applicability of results to evaluating management strategies and/or defining the relevance of future research. No set budget limit exists for individual projects; however, efficiency will be another criteria used in evaluating projects. Ability to leverage or to match funds from other sources is also a plus. Proposals should be 2-5 pages and include enough information for a reviewer to understand how the objectives of the project will be met. No specific form is required for proposals. Relevant information to be included is identified in a draft template at the end of this document.

          "Description": "The Department of Energy (DOE), Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) intends to issue, on behalf of the Solar Energy Technologies Office, a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled ?Sustainable and Holistic IntegratioN of Energy storage and Solar PV (SHINES)?. As solar power plants proliferate, the variability and uncertainty of the solar resource poses challenges for integrating PV with electric power systems, both at the distribution and bulk system levels. The goal of a potential FOA from the Department of Energy is to enable holistic design, development, and widespread sustainable deployment of low-cost, flexible, and reliable solutions that have energy storage as one of the key components for successful integration of PV power plants. The SHINES solution can incorporate, in addition to PV and energy storage, options such as demand response and load management to achieve target metrics of the FOA. The total Federal funding will be approximately $15M, subject to the availability of annual appropriations, with a minimum 50% awardee cost share required. Projects are expected to be funded with a maximum award level of $5M. These projects are anticipated to directly support the SunShot Systems Integration mission of enabling the technolog ies and processes for sustainable and holistic integration of 100s of GW of solar generation into the power system. The purpose of this Notice of Intent (NOI) is to provide interested parties advance notice that EERE intends to issue a FOA in the near term titled, Sustainable and Holistic IntegratioN of Energy storage and Solar PV (SHINES). NO APPLICATIONS WILL BE ACCEPTED THROUGH THIS NOI. All of the information contained in this Notice is subject to change. EERE will not respond to questions concerning this Notice. If the FOA is released, EERE will provide an avenue for potential Applicants to submit questions. EERE plans to issue the FOA on or after October 20, 2014 via the EERE Exchange website (https://eere-exchange.energy.gov/). If Applicants wish to receive official notifications and information from EERE regarding this FOA, they should register in EERE Exchange or Grants.gov. If the FOA is released, applications will be accepted only through EERE Exchange. This is a Notice of Intent only. DOE may issue a FOA as described herein, may issue a FOA that is significantly different than the FOA described herein, or may not issue a FOA at all.",

Health Center Program grants support a variety of community-based and patient-directed public and private nonprofit organizations that serve an increasing number of the Nation&amp;#191;s underserved. Individually, each health center plays an important role in the goal of ensuring access to services, and combined, they have had a critical impact on the health care status of medically underserved and vulnerable populations throughout the United States and its territories. The Health Center Program targets the Nation&amp;#191;s neediest populations and geographic areas by currently funding approximately 1,300 health centers that operate over 9,000 service delivery sites in every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and the Pacific Basin. In 2013, more than 21 million patients, including medically underserved and uninsured patients, received comprehensive, culturally competent, quality primary health care services through the Health Center Program. This Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) solicits applications for the Health Center Program&amp;#191;s Service Area Competition (SAC). The FOA details the SAC eligibility requirements, review criteria, and awarding factors for organizations seeking a grant for operational support of an announced service area under the Health Center Program, including Community Health Center (CHC &amp;#191; section 330(e)), Migrant Health Center (MHC &amp;#191; section 330(g)), Health Care for the Homeless (HCH &amp;#191; section 330(h)), and/or Public Housing Primary Care (PHPC &amp;#191; section 330(i)). For the purposes of this document, the term &amp;#191;health center&amp;#191; refers to the diverse types of health centers (i.e., CHC, MHC, HCH, and /or PHPC) supported under section 330 of the PHS Act, as amended.",

Proposals for narrow technology or subsystem development, or incremental or near-term advancement, are explicitly out of scope for this program. Finally, while NIAC encourages daring vision and accepts the accompanying risk, proposals must be technically credible and plausibly implementable. NIAC is part of the Space Technology Mission Directorate. The 2015 NIAC Phase I solicitation will be a two-step process. Step A will be a 3-page white paper plus summary chart. Proposals shall be submitted electronically, and all Step A proposers shall use the NASA Solicitation and Proposal Integrated Review and Evaluation System (NSPIRES), accessible at http://nspires.nasaprs.com , or for Step A may also use Grants.gov. Step B full proposals will be eligible only if invited after review of a Step A submission. Step B proposals shall be submitted electronically through NSPIRES only. This solicitation will be an open announcement; anyone is welcome to respond. Affiliation with any educational institution, commercial or not-for-profit organization, research laboratory, government agency, or NASA Center (including the Jet Propulsion Laboratory) is permitted. Individuals may submit, as long as they meet the registration requirements for NSPIRES. Every organization that intends to submit a proposal in response to this NRA must be registered with NSPIRES, and such registration must identify the authorized organizational representative(s) who will submit the electronic proposal. Each electronic proposal system places requirements on the registration of principal investigators and other participants (e.g. co-investigators). Potential proposers and proposing organizations are urged to access the electronic proposal system(s) well in advance of the proposal due date(s) to familiarize themselves with its structure and enter the requested information. Specific proposal submission deadline dates, evaluation criteria, and submission information will be identified in the NRA. Step A White Papers will be due on or before Wednesday, November 12th, 2014; Step B full Proposals will be due on or before Wednesday, January 21st , 2015. 12-16 NIAC Phase I awards are anticipated, but the final number of awards will depend on the quality of proposals and availability of appropriated funds.",

THIS RFI IS NOT A FUNDING OPPORTUNITY ANNOUNCEMENT (FOA); THEREFORE, DOE IS NOT ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS. EERE intends to issue, on behalf of the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), a Funding Opportunity Announcement (FOA) entitled ?Assisting Federal Facilities with Energy Conservation Technologies, Fiscal Year 2015 (AFFECT 2015).? This RFI seeks input from interested parties and stakeholders regarding the subject of the anticipated FOA and related details. If the FOA is issued, it will likely provide grants to Federal agencies for renewable energy projects that are incorporated into a privately financed performance contract, such as an Energy Savings Performance Contract or Utility Energy Service Contract, or as part of a renewable energy Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Applications for renewable energy projects that are financed through appropriations will also be considered. A key merit review criterion will likely be how much private and/or agency funds are leveraged against the FEMP AFFECT grant funding. Highly leveraging outside funds thro ugh performance contracting is important, because it will lead to projects of greater impact. If the FOA is issued, it will be released at some point in Fiscal Year 2015, which began October 1, 2014 and ends September 30, 2015.",

          "Description": "Despite centuries of discovery, most of our planet&amp;apos;s biodiversity remains unknown. The scale of the unknown diversity on Earth is especially troubling given the rapid and permanent loss of biodiversity across the globe. With this loss, humanity is losing links in the web of life that provide ecosystem services, forfeiting an understanding of the history and future of the living world, and losing opportunities for future beneficial discoveries in the domains of food, fiber, fuel, pharmaceuticals, and bio-inspired innovation.The goal of the Dimensions of Biodiversity campaign is to transform, by 2020, how we describe and understand the scope and role of life on Earth. The campaign promotes novel, integrated approaches to identify and understand the evolutionary and ecological significance of biodiversity amidst the changing environment of the present day and in the geologic past.This campaign seeks to characterize biodiversity on Earth by using integrative, innovative approaches to fill the most substantial gaps in our understanding of the diversity of life on Earth. It takes a broad view of biodiversity, and currently focuses on the integration of genetic, taxonomic/phylogenetic, and functional dimensions of biodiversity. Successful proposals should integrate these three dimensions to understand interactions and feedbacks among them. While this focus complements several core NSF programs, it differs by requiring that multiple dimensions of biodiversity be addressed simultaneously, in innovative or novel ways, to understand their synergistic roles in critical ecological and evolutionary processes.Investigators wishing to inquire about the suitability of potential projects for Dimensions of Biodiversity are encouraged to email a brief summary and contact information to Dimensions@nsf.gov.",

          "Description": "The Computing Education for the 21st Century (CE21) program aims to build a robust computing research community, a computationally competent 21st century workforce, and a computationally empowered citizenry. In this undertaking, there are three interrelated challenges: the significant underproduction of degrees needed for the computing and computing-related workforce, the longstanding underrepresentation of many segments of our population, and the lack of a presence of computing in K-12. Innovation in information technology (IT) has driven economic growth, underlies many of our recent scientific advances, and ensures our national security; it is not surprising then that predicted IT job growth is very strong. Yet students are not majoring in computing in sufficient numbers. This shortfall is exacerbated by the longstanding underrepresentation of women, persons with disabilities, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans and indigenous peoples in computing. We cannot meet workforce demands without their participation and we cannot, in an increasingly competitive world economy, afford to cede the talents and creativity of so many. To ensure their participation, and the full participation of all students, we must provide better opportunities to study computing in K-12. We must start with a better understanding of how students learn computing. Unlike many of the other STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) disciplines, computing has not developed a robust research base on the teaching and learning of its fundamental concepts and skills. That research base must be built and it must be used in providing all students with rigorous academic curricula that cover computational concepts and skills, and the breadth of application and potential of computing. Providing access to rigorous, academic computing in K-12 will require an unprecedented effort to develop curriculum and materials and to prepare teachers.CE21 thus supports efforts in three tracks: Computing Education Research (CER) proposals will aim to develop a research base for computing education. Projects may conduct basic research on the teaching and learning of computational competencies; they may design, develop, test, validate, and refine materials, measurement tools, and methods for teaching in specific contexts; and/or they may implement promising small-scale interventions in order to study their efficacy with particular groups. Efforts can focus on computational thinking as taught in computing courses or infused across the curriculum, they can target students or their teachers in informal or formal educational settings, or they can address any level within the K-16 pipeline, from elementary school through high school and college. CS 10K proposals will aim to develop the knowledge base and partnerships needed to catalyze the CS 10K Project. The CS 10K Project aims to have rigorous, academic curricula incorporated into computing courses in 10,000 high schools, taught by 10,000 well-trained teachers. CS 10K proposals can address a wide range of needed activities, including the development of course materials, pedagogy, and methods courses, as well as professional development and ongoing support for teachers, approaches to scaling, best practices for increasing the participation of students from underrepresented groups, and strategies for building K-12, university, and community partnerships. Broadening Participation (BP) proposals will aim to develop and assess novel interventions that contribute to our knowledge base on the effective teaching and learning of computing for students from the underrepresented groups: women, persons with disabilities, African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans and indigenous peoples. Proposed interventions should be designed to engage and retain students from these groups and, at the same time, to increase their knowledge of computational thinking concepts and skills. Proposers are encouraged to leverage the resources provided by the existing BPC-A Alliances and to develop interventions that, if proven successful, could be implemented within a BPC-A Alliance. For additional information on the Alliances, see http://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=503593&amp;amp;org=NSF.In aggregate, CE21 projects will contribute to our understanding of how diverse student populations are engaged and retained in computing, learn its fundamental concepts, and develop computational competencies that position them to contribute to an increasingly computationally empowered workforce.",

          "Description": "The Wildlife Without Borders Critically Endangered Animals Conservation Fund will fund projects that conserve the world&amp;#191;s most endangered species. Species eligible for funding are those that face a very high risk of extinction in the immediate future. Species should meet the criteria to be listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered on the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List. Species listed as Data Deficient on the IUCN Red List are also eligible if the applicant can provide information that suggests a similar urgency for conservation action. Species listed as Extinct in Wild are eligible if the applicant is proposing a reintroduction attempt.The following species are NOT eligible for funding: Species with natural habitat range located primarily within the United States, territories of the United States, Canada, and the high income economies of Europe; Species that are eligible for funding under one of the Multinational Species Conservation Fund programs, including: Asian elephant, African elephant, rhinoceros (all species), tiger (all sub-species), gorilla, chimpanzee, bonobo, orangutan, gibbons (all species) and marine turtles (all species); and Amphibian species that are eligible for funding through the Wildlife Without Borders - Amphibians in Decline program, including frogs, toads, salamanders, newts, and caecilians. The goal of this grants program is to reduce threats to highly endangered wildlife in their natural habitat. Proposals should identify specific conservation actions that have a high likelihood of creating durable benefits. Project activities that emphasize data collection and status assessment should describe a direct link to management action, and explain how lack of information has been a key limiting factor for management action in the past. Proposals that do not identify how actions will reduce threats, or do not demonstrate a strong link between data collection and management action, have a lower likelihood of being selected.Proposed project work should occur within the species range, or, if work is to be conducted outside of the range, the proposal should show a clear relevance to its conservation. Proposals that emphasize ex-situ conservation and captive management have a lower likelihood of being selected.",

The Consortium will form multi-disciplinary teams composed of members from the CCs and CDMC to undertake a comprehensive clinical, epidemiological and biological characterization of patients with CP (including those with Acute Recurrent Pancreatitis, ARP) to gain insight into the pathophysiology of chronic pancreatitis and its sequela: chronic pain, pancreatic insufficiency, T3cDM and the diabetes/pancreatic cancer association. The teams will also undertake studies on the development of pancreatic cancer in newly diagnosed diabetic patients. Applications for the consortium Clinical Centers are being solicited via RFA-DK-14-027 &amp;quot;Consortium for the Study of Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes and Pancreatic Cancer Clinical Centers (CSCPDPC-CCs) (U01)&amp;quot;. To achieve the goal of a comprehensive characterization of evolving chronic pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer, the Coordinating and Data Management Center (CDMC) will take on the administrative and data collection/analysis functions and will be responsible for the conduct of all of the ongoing and future studies of the CCs. In addition, a major collaborative effort within the Consortium will be the establishment of an annotated repository of bio-specimens (blood, pancreatic and duodenal juice, stools and when feasible pancreatic tissue) to allow for the identification and validation of biomarkers for risk stratification and/or early detection.",
